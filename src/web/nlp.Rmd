### **KNN on TF-IDF**  
257,123 abstracts were identified as big data when using TF-IDF to vectorize the abstracts and KNN as a classifier. 
```{r echo=FALSE}
library(DT)

datatable(read.csv("short_tf.csv"),options = list(pageLength = 3, columnDefs = list(list(
  targets = 3,
  render = JS(
    "function(data, type, row, meta) {",
    "return type === 'display' && data.length > 200 ?",
    "'<span title=\"' + data + '\">' + data.substr(0, 200) + '...</span>' : data;",
    "}")
))), callback = JS('table.page(0).draw(false);'))

```
Above can be seen a sample of the abstracts that were identified as big data using TF-IDF. Information such as their department, agency, project dates, and costs were recorded. This information will later be used to model further trends in the abstracts.  
```{r echo=FALSE}
library(DT)
datatable(read.csv("tf_depart.csv"))
```
The breakdown of department of the abstracts that were identified as big data using TF-IDF is shown above. The vast majority of the abstracts were from HSS which is representative of the proportion of HSS documents in the corpus.

### **KNN on Doc2Vec**  
484,362 abstracts were identified as relating to big data by using Doc2Vec to classify the documents and KNN to classify them. 
```{r echo=FALSE}
library(DT)
datatable(read.csv("short_doc.csv"),options = list(pageLength = 3, columnDefs = list(list(
  targets = 3,
  render = JS(
    "function(data, type, row, meta) {",
    "return type === 'display' && data.length > 200 ?",
    "'<span title=\"' + data + '\">' + data.substr(0, 200) + '...</span>' : data;",
    "}")
))), callback = JS('table.page(1).draw(false);'))
