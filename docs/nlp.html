GaME is a method for applying cognitive science metaphor theory toward the design of computer-mediated learning environments. The process uses structure mapping theory to design videogame worlds aligned with science concepts. This is a rigorous specification procedure for mapping relational structure from targeted concept to game world. GaME design translates a targeted concept into a game system, game play, and game goal. Because the relational structure of the game world is designed as an analog of the targeted conceptual domain, players begin to construct mental models of the targeted concept during interactive gameplay. This makes learning concrete and embodied. Gameplay experiences are designed to guide the learner to discover the relational structure of the targeted concept. This gameplay is a readiness activity for preparing the learner for subsequent instruction. The primary objective of the Cyber-Enabled Teaching and Learning through Game-based, Metaphor Enhanced Learning Objects (CyGaMEs) project is to empirically test this application of cognitive science theory. Aptly designed videogame worlds will provide common experience that prepares educators and their learners to achieve success. CyGaMEs employs cognitive science, informatic sciences, and analysis methodologies to enhance control over what games do: Engage learning through doing, discovery, and inquiry. While each player takes an idiosyncratic route, applied structure mapping theory ensures that gameplay exploration proceeds toward the learning goal.  Selene: A Lunar Creation GaME is the core of CyGaMEs research. This project will: (a) complete, refine and test existing Selene prototype, (b) collect GaME data representing perceptions and learning, (c) develop and refine new methods and metrics for assessing motivation, engagement, and achievement within instructional videogames, and (d) integrate GaME data collection and assessment within a cyber-enabled informatics infrastructure.","In partnership with the American Chemical Society (ACS) and the National Academy of Sciences (NAS), the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) will convene two roundtable meetings in conjunction with the ACS National Meetings in 2008 and 2009. The meetings will promote continued, multinational dialogue on establishing effective programs for funding international collaborative research projects in chemistry; and will also deepen the engagement between the U.S. chemical sciences community, the ACS, and the international Union.These meetings will stimulate the further development of productive collaborative activities between international research communities and help advance the development of more effective mechanisms for international collaborative research in chemistry. The meetings will be of widespread and enduring benefit to the community.","MAPPING / CHARACTERIZATION / AND ANALYSIS OF CHANNEL/VALLEY FEATURES ON TITAN- Elongate sinuous features interpreted as fluvial in origin have been identified on Titan in data from all three of Cassini''s imaging instruments - the Cassini Titan Radar Mapp","Amphibian populations around the world are experiencing declines and mass mortalities at an unprecedented rate. The fungal disease chytridiomycosis is a primary cause of this epidemic, and differential susceptibility among species occurring in similar environments suggests that genetics may determine how individuals respond to infection. Zamudio and Lips will combine field and laboratory studies to test whether variability in immunity genes of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) confer differential survivorship to this emerging infectious disease, and how the disease itself alters the genetic and demographic composition of populations following an outbreak. The proposal focuses on frog populations in Central America where chytridiomycosis lethality is prevalent; however, their findings will be applicable to amphibian populations worldwide.This project will provide a better understanding of how emerging diseases shape adaptive molecular evolution, and how variability in immunity genes contribute to the response to novel disease threats. This research will quantify the molecular effects of this disease in ?real-time?, in addition to the genetic determinants of survivorship, resulting in useful epidemiological predictions for other populations or species that have yet to be exposed to the disease.","The Ohio State University College of Education (OSU), the National Middle School Association (NMSA), and Education Development Center (EDC) are providing a stewardship role for middle level educators of mathematics and science by creating the Math and Science Middle School Pathways Portal, or MSP2. While continuing to create and offer contextualized, high-quality resources, MSP2 is also capitalizing on Web 2.0 tools to promote interactivity, collaboration, and knowledge sharing among its users. Additionally, MSP2 is expanding its scope of influence through a new section designed for middle school aged youth and new resources related to career development, 21st century skills, and STEM careers. The portal also provides a virtual professional learning community of middle level math and science teachers. Project partners are integrating resources, tools, and services across projects, and supporting multiple methods of resource discovery to meets the needs of this audience. Collaboration among these and other organizations is providing the longer-term sustainability and stewardship of MSP2. The project evaluation is determining the impact of the project on its target audiences and the educational uses of Web 2.0 tools and services.MSP2 enhances the infrastructure for research and education by continuing to develop a contextualized, high-quality resource collection, building and supporting networks of middle grades math and science teachers through a virtual professional learning community, and supporting the educational use of Web 2.0 tools and services. Dissemination of knowledge, experience, and research results is a significant aspect of the project. The project partners are reaching diverse audiences through conferences, meetings, online events, print publications, and Web communications.","This empirical study examines the variety of materials used and the myriad of teaching strategies employed by U.S. high school mathematics teachers in their effort to prepare students for later success in college calculus, a requirement for most STEM majors. Designed as a retrospective cohort study, we use 12,000 college calculus students' histories to predict performance while controlling for demographic differences. This study has the capability to both reveal the most promising educational practices in mathematics, including technological innovations, and to assess the degree of match between high school math and college calculus courses, both traditional and reform based.","The overall goal of this project is to investigate joint influences of genetic propensities and social-control on delinquent behavior. Previous sociological work has demonstrated the critical importance of social structural conditions, family processes, school structure, and peer networks.  These serve as informal social controls that bond individuals to social norms and ultimately may reduce delinquency.  The project draws data sources from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health) to address the question of why some individuals become serious and violent delinquents while others do not, despite growing up in a similar social context and participating in similar social processes.  Dr. Guo and his research teams will investigate the role of genetic propensities, especially as they interact with social control factors, in delinquency.  Specifically, they will use genotype data focusing on the genes that are known to be involved in aggressive behavior in mice to explore how genetic factors might influence delinquency and how those influences may depend on social control processes measured at the levels of friends, peers, family, school, and neighborhood.  This research is based on the premise that genetic effects on delinquency are best understood within a social science theoretical framework, which provides the basis for understanding delinquent behavior as socially produced and socially organized human activity. The newly created molecular genotype data will be merged with the rich social and behavioral longitudinal data in Add Health for other researchers to use.  The results of this study would contribute to the understanding of aggression and delinquency across the life course and could inform intervention efforts.","TERC is partnering with the Toxics Action Center to enhance the capacity of environmental organizations to teach mathematical literacy skills to low-income citizens, mostly women of color. Secondary collaborators include four environmental organizations around the country. The project is (1) developing math- and statistics-rich educational materials that help non-scientists interpret environmental test results, (2) developing training materials that help environmental organization personnel provide quantitative literacy training to citizens, (3) helping environmental organizations institutionalize project resources, and (4) evaluating the impact of project activities on environmental organizers, community members, and the general public. Project deliverables include bilingual, print- and web-based instructional materials (including videos) for environmental organizations to use with staff and community members; training sessions to create a cadre of environmental organization leaders who can conduct environment-focused, math training workshops; a communications toolkit for dissemination to journalists who cover environmental issues; and a resource-rich project web site.","The Inland Northwest Community Access Network (TINCAN), the Puget Sound Center for Teaching, Learning and Technology (PSCTLT), and Reel Grrls (a community media center) are partnering to involve 6th and 7th grade middle school girls in science-focused after-school club activities in 10 schools in Seattle and Spokane, Washington. The Science Journalism Pathways to STEM Careers project is engaging girls in science journalism through information and communication technologies (ICT) to investigate and publish information about local science issues of interest to their communities. The ICT focus is video, multimedia, and the Internet. Girls are also conducting hands-on activities and interviewing STEM professionals to learn issue-related science content. The goals of the project are to (1) increase girls' ICT fluency, (2) increase girls' science literacy, (3) increase girls' interest in STEM careers, and (4) increase STEM content in non-science courses taught by social studies teachers who manage the after-school clubs.","ABSTRACT0736126 PI: BardeenThis award is for I2U2: Interactions in Understanding the Universe, an  educational virtual organization  (EDVO), which is designed to strengthen the education and outreach activities of scientific experiments at U.S. universities and laboratoriesby providing infrastructure support and a program framework for a portfolio of coherent, collaborative online science education laboratories. I2U2 maintains a growing online portfolio of educational laboratories for a diverse range of disciplines and provides tools and support services to assist developers in creating these educational resources. These laboratories break new ground by using the national Grid cyberinfrastructure for education in the same way that science increasingly uses the Grid.   I2U2 collaboratories take two similar but distinct shapes. ?e-Labs,? delivered as Web-based portals accessible in the classroom and at home, are implemented with the ever-expanding capabilities of Web-based media. ?i-Labs,? are delivered as interactive interfaces typically located within science museums and similar public venues.   I2U2 will deploy and maintain itself as a ?virtual organization? to provide support for participants across project boundaries and from many different home institutions who share a common interest in developing Grid-based education and outreach resources, and who seek to communicate, coordinate and reach their target audience through the Internet and the Grid.   I2U2 will also extensively evaluate and assess the effectiveness and use of the portfolio of science education laboratories.","The study of earth's topography has fundamental impacts on society, from flood and landslide prevention and control to the understanding of climate change impacts, management of land-use practices, as well as design of roads and other man-made projects in an environmentally sustainable way.  The recent availability of high resolution (0.5 m spacing) digital topography from airborne laser swath mapping and ground-based lidar offers opportunities to develop a new class of environmental predictive models that explicitly incorporate important features of the landscape and thus enhance the accuracy of predictions. The goal of this project is to develop modern computational geometric image analysis methodologies applicable to hydrologic and eco-geomorphologic hazard prediction and control. Specifically, the project studies high-resolution, multiscale, and dynamic topography with the goal of extracting channel networks, channel banks and shapes, floodplains and hazard-relevant features such as landslide prone areas and service roads which contribute to increased sediment production and thus stream habitat deterioration.  The mathematical and computational techniques to be exploited and developed come from the area of geometric non-linear partial differential equations and energy formulations, combined with differential and computational geometry. Specifically, a combination of methodologies ranging from geometric scale-space theory to singularity theory and geometric variational principles, combined with optimal algorithms for computing special curves on surfaces, will be exploited to derive a complete and automatic analysis of the topography at multiple relevant scales.","****NON-TECHNICAL ABSTRACT****This Small Grant for Exploratory Research enhances research opportunities for minority students at a Historically Black University.  It will allow them to contribute to the discovery process, including experimental research and the exchange of ideas at the frontier of science.  The project will attempt to elucidate whether an interpretation for the transport behavior of electrons in bismuth (Bi) nanowires when subjected to high magnetic fields is also valid for the recently observed behavior exhibited by charge carriers in bulk single crystal Bi.  The observed effects in bulk Bi have been interpreted as being due to the electrons in bulk Bi behaving like electrons constrained to moving only in a thin layer (i.e., exhibiting the fractional charge of a collective quantum state of 2 dimensional electrons).  The transport behavior in Bi nanowires has been interpreted as arising from electrons near the surface of the wire (i.e., the surface states).  However, there are similarities between the magnetic field dependent transport measurements of Bi nanowires and bulk Bi.  Low temperature electronic transport measurements in magnetic fields on bulk Bi will be performed.  These measurements are designed to reveal the possible contributions from surface states and fractional charge.  This timely project could be transformative in our understanding of Bi in the quantum limit and lead to future technologies.  ****TECHNICAL ABSTRACT****This Small Grant for Exploratory Research enhances research opportunities for minority students at a Historically Black University.

Recent experimental studies of the Nernst effect and Hall effect of bulk Bi in the quantum limit (magnetic fields larger than 9 Tesla) have been interpreted in terms of charge fractionalization, an unusual collective quantum state seen only in two-dimensional electron gases.  Absorption peaks with the same Shubnikov-deHaas period of 0.03/T have been observed in the magnetoresistance and thermopower of Bi nanowires both below and above the quantum limit of 9 T.  In this case an interpretation in terms of surface states related to a spin-orbit surface interaction was proposed. Measurements of the magnetoresistance and Hall effect of thin samples of bulk single-crystal bismuth in magnetic fields up to 45 T will be performed.  These measurements are designed to reveal possible contributions by surface states and fractional charge, allow evaluation of their properties such as effective masses, and permit evaluation of the relative importance of surface effects and electronic transport by bulk-like electrons and holes in bulk Bi.  This timely project could be transformative in our understanding of Bi in the quantum limit and lead to future technologies.","0332103   Aultman-Hall   The overall goal of this research is to characterize the relationships between spatial transportation-related variables (e.g., road type, grade, traffic conditions, land-use patterns), vehicle operating conditions (speed, acceleration, load) and mobile source fine particulate matter (PM) emissions. The project has three objectives. First, we will develop operating mode-based PM emissions models for light-duty vehicles based on real-world tailpipe emissions data. Second, vehicle operating mode and PM emissions will be modeled spatially as a function of transportation network variables and the surrounding land use environment. Finally, transient operating events will be studied to determine the associated PM emissions and their spatial distribution.","SciGirls, produced by Twin Cities Public Television, is a new PBS 13-part half-hour television series with accompanying Web and outreach activities targeted to girls ages 8 - 13-year olds.  The intended impacts are to 1) to foster a greater interest in STEM among girls ages 8 to 13 and their parents, with girls from diverse communities the highest priority; 2) connect girls to existing, quality STEM education opportunities in their communities; and 3) contribute to the growing body of research to deepen understanding of the most effective ways to engage girls in STEM activities and encourage them to pursue STEM careers.  The project?s two strategic partners are the National Girls Collaborative Project (NGCP) in Seattle, and The Franklin Institute in Philadelphia.  The NGCP will link SciGirls TV with its network of 500 community-based science programs for girls, and The Franklin Institute will help form an affiliate network of science museums to implement SciGirls TV outreach activities.  In addition to the broadcasts on PBS Plus, the videos will be distributed via online streaming and DVD?s, as well as via versions that can be downloaded to portable video players.  The most significant web component will be a social networking feature that will allow girls interested in science to connect with others across the nation.  Barbara Flagg of Multimedia Research will conduct formative evaluation of the first rough cuts, and a subsequent summative evaluation of the completed programs and of the social networking web site.","Morgan State University and Baltimore City Public School System (BCPSS) are core partners for the MSP-Start  BRAIN-STEM  project which is building the necessary institutional infrastructure, in both the university and the school system, to implement activities that integrate mathematical and biological concepts in a manner that can be incorporated into high school mathematics and science courses.  From a content perspective, they are focusing on discrete mathematics and genomics as material that is interesting, engaging, and at an appropriate level for success.  They are conducting a needs analysis in the BCPSS by collecting and analyzing student achievement and teacher characteristic data in grades 9 - 12 math and science.  They are using these results in designing a project that addresses the content and pedagogical needs of Baltimore City Public School System (BCSS) life sciences and mathematics teachers through the use of integrated problem-based learning that incorporates standards-based mathematics instruction and inquiry-based science instruction.  Furthermore, they are using their evaluation outcomes as the basis for developing a full MSP Targeted Partnership proposal.Morgan State University is a public, coeducational university which primarily serves students from underrepresented minority backgrounds.  Baltimore City Public School System (BCPSS) serves over 87,000 students in urban and non-urban settings in Baltimore, Maryland, including 37 different high schools.  About 75% of the school age children in the Baltimore City Public School district are African American.","Much of the literature on technological innovation focuses on analyzing measures of the scientific, technical, or commercial productivity of specific types of innovation-related activities in isolation, and does not consider the overall productivity of the linked sequences of these activities that constitute an innovation chain, from scientific discovery through commercialization. There currently is a gap in understanding of how different types of individual innovative activities come to be linked sequentially in a chain of events that ultimately may produce new commercial products or processes. Similarly, little is known about the organizational and institutional determinants of the overall productivity of linked sequences of such innovative events over time and space. This project analyzes the economic, organizational, and institutional determinants of the probability of a successful transition between such innovative events, and ultimately, toward commercially successful innovation, at each stage along the innovation chain. Data gleaned from patents, scientific publications, literature and patent citations, licensing agreements, research funding, and collaborative agreements are being used to construct a novel database of spatial and temporal linkages between activities and entities at each stage along an innovation chain, and to develop qualitative and quantitative indicators of knowledge and technology flows within these chains of linked events. The database is being constructed using case studies of nano-electronic innovations in the semiconductor industry, and applications of biotechnology innovations in the pharmaceutical industry. This research focus is inspired by efforts within these two mature high technology industries to experiment with novel strategies to integrate emerging technologies into their innovation pipelines. The variety and breadth of organizational, institutional, and funding strategies used to coordinate innovative activities in these industries provides a rich and varied set of data to be used in developing indicators and understanding of knowledge and technology flows. Broader Impacts: Although this research focuses on the semiconductor and pharmaceutical industries, the analysis should also have a broader impact in the development of more generally applicable stylized facts about determinants of the innovative process. The indicators of knowledge and technology flows being constructed are available for use as data in estimation of econometric models of determinants of the probability of a given R&amp;D project successfully transitioning to various possible types of successor projects along an innovation chain, and ultimately, resulting in commercialization. Analysis of this database using a structural model provides empirical insights into the economic, organizational and structural factors that maximize the probability of success for innovation-related projects. These insights are a significant contribution to the development of a science of science and innovation policy. Further, decision makers in both the public and private sectors should be able to use these results to help choose among different possible organizational, institutional, and funding strategies, and improve the odds of successful innovation resulting from supported projects.","The Concow-Maidu Indians of northern California now live primarily on the Berry Creek, Enterprise, Mooretown rancherias, and neighboring communities. With support from the National Science Foundation, Julie McIntosh (Mooretown Rancheria of Maidu Indians of California) and her team will document the nearly extinct Northwestern Maidu language (also called Konkow or Concow Maidu).  It is now believed to have no more than four fluent speakers, and thus the urgency of the documentation effort is great. Although other Maiduan languages, particularly Northeastern (Mountain) Maidu, have received scholarly attention, Northwestern Maidu has so far been the subject of only limited study, and virtually none within the past forty years. The project will make video and audio recording of the speech of the remaining speakers; transcribe selected recordings; create a lexical database from both earlier sources and current speakers, and create an inventory of all extant written and electronic materials relating to the language. All language documentation materials will be prepared in a variety of paper, analog, and digital formats to make them maximally available both to the local indigenous communities and to researchers. With the silencing of hundreds of languages in the past decades, it has never been clearer that every human language represents a unique intellectual achievement, and that the loss of any language is a loss of knowledge that has repercussions far beyond the local community. The documentation of the Concow Maidu language will set the foundation for integrated research activities for the Maidu community, as well as for linguists. These first steps in documentation will prepare the way for the creation of a variety of resources to be used in language revitalization, both pedagogical materials and a grammar.","LIGHT RUNNERS STEREO SPACE MISSION E/PO  Light Runners  is a touring E/PO program that provides unprecedented access to STEREO space mission imagery data to the blind and visually handicapped as well as sighted populations across the country. The program","Health care delivery in the U.S. is experiencing severe and worsening problems.  Costs are higher than in other countries and continue to increase, yet the overall quality of care delivered is not improving.  Increasing demand for health care as baby boomers become elderly is further straining the care delivery system.  Thus, dramatic changes are needed in health care delivery in the U.S. over the next decade.  One proposed solution is computer systems designed for health care, called health information technology (HIT).  These HIT systems, particularly electronic health records (EHR) that store patients? medical history and their interactions with physicians, promise significant improve¬ments in quality, effectiveness and productivity of care delivery.  Yet simply installing HIT without significantly changing existing work processes is unlikely to produce needed results. What is needed is an in-depth under¬standing of how HIT and process design techniques should be conceptualized and applied in health care. This project develops theories that can transform health care delivery processes in the U.S., through a deep understanding of the changes needed to make effective use of HIT and process design techniques.  The questions we address are: What capabilities does an EHR provide and which are used by health care organizations?  Which characteristics of the health care context, including characteristics of countries, the physician and nursing professions, and health care organizations, enable and inhibit the ability of health care organizations to take advantage of what EHR systems provide?  What are the dynamics of change by which EHR capabilities affect care delivery processes?  How and why do new EHR systems improve or reduce the quality and productivity of health care delivery processes?  How do health care organizations and individuals working in them need to change to make the most effective use of new EHR systems?  Answers to these questions will provide the knowledge needed to transform health care delivery processes in the U.S.This team will conduct multiple case studies of EHR implementation in health care organizations to understand the dynamics of change as the EHR implementation alters health care delivery processes.  The case studies will be carried out at our partner organizations, Fallon Clinic, UMass Memorial Health Care, Canada?s single payer system in British Columbia, and two of Israel?s four Health Fund systems.  These four settings provide different health care contexts, enabling us to observe and learn from their differences.  Improving the quality of health care delivered in the U.S. as well as reducing its cost has become a critically important societal goal.  The health care system is reaching a breaking point, and needs to be changed.  Simplistic solutions, however, will not work. Solutions require an interdisciplinary approach and the holistic, in-depth understanding of the variety of forces influencing change that will be studied in this project.  The work produced will provide a foundation for a larger community of researchers transforming HIT and process design ideas to solve health care delivery problems.","Computer gaming and simulations enjoy great popularity and are used by the military and corporate world to enhance training. Their potential to support science learning, however, is relatively untapped. The Board on Science Education (BOSE) at the National Research Council (NRC) proposes to hold a two-day workshop to explore the connections between what is known about science learning and computer gaming and simulations, the role computer gaming and simulations could play in assessing learning, and the pathways by which they could be used on a large scale. The workshop will be the basis for the development of a research agenda to gain a better of understanding of how gaming and simulations can support learning and assessment in science.","The Binding Principles, perhaps the most well studied principles in human language, state where in a sentence nominals (e.g., pronouns, common and proper nouns, etc.) may occur, and what they may/may not refer to. Many prominent researchers argue that these principles are part of our innate linguistic endowment because (i) they occur in the vast majority of languages for which we have data, and (ii) children in every language studied to date exhibit them at the very earliest testable ages. This argument for innateness is threatened somewhat by the existence of a handful of languages, e.g., Thai, in which the Binding Principles appear not to hold. If these principles are innate, exceptional languages like Thai should not exist.So why don't Thai speakers obey the Binding Principles? Thai children hold the answer to this puzzle: if Thai children, unlike Thai adults, exhibit knowledge of the Binding Principles at young ages, this will show that the principles are indeed part of our innate linguistic endowment, and that as children mature, they 'unlearn' these principles on the basis of adult input. However, if Thai children show no evidence of the Binding Principles at any stage in development, this will suggest that the principles are not innate. If this is the case, children acquiring other languages (e.g., English) do not have access to these innate principles, and must simply learn them on the basis of experience and other (non-linguistic) mechanisms. This project will test 80 Thai children aged 3yrs-7yrs and 20 adult Thai speakers on six experiments, each targeting a different aspect of the Binding Principles. The project will not only address one of the biggest debates in cognitive science (nature versus nurture), but it will also gather data from an understudied language, as well as establish and foster relations between academic institutions in Thailand and the United States. Moreover, this work will lay the foundation for the development of standards for the acquisition of Thai that may be used for Speech Pathology or educational assessment purposes.","The State of Alabama has committed to expanding and sustaining its bioscience and nanotechnology resources, providing opportunities for K-20 synergism and leveraging of state resources.  With an ultimate objective to have all students prepared and well grounded in math and science technology, thereby improving the economic landscape for future scientists, researchers, and technicians, this MSP-Start project is researching, planning, and developing a full MSP Partnership between an EPSCoR program, nano- and biotechnology industries in Alabama, the Alabama Department of Education, and Alabama public school systems.  A distinctive characteristic of this work is that it brings together the highly organized Alabama Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (ALEPSCoR) into a partnership to promote STEM education in K-12 schools, with a vision of using ALEPSCoR programming and institutions to raise academic standards and student performance.  The long-term goals of the new partnership are:      1.  To improve current K-12 programs by raising student achievement levels through cooperation of existing NSF-supported nanotechnology, biotechnology and sensor ALEPSCoR research groups, the Alabama Math, Science, and Technology Initiative (AMSTI), and school districts throughout Alabama.      2.  To change the culture of higher education through training of ALEPSCoR-sponsored graduate students - the next generation of researchers and innovators - on education and outreach activities.      3.  To research and evaluate a method for incorporating EPSCoR research-based activities into K-12 programs in other EPSCoR states as an innovative partnership model. The MSP-Start project builds on existing educational partnerships to form a comprehensive new MSP Partnership, through a process led by Alabama teachers and faculty at Tuskegee University, Alabama A&amp;M University, Alabama State University, Auburn University, and campuses of the University of Alabama system.  The scope of work for the participants in the MSP-Start project is to develop plans to leverage their strengths while evolving the new partnership, especially addressing all of the components of the national MSP program.","SES-0817659Rachel L. EinwohnerPurdue UniversityThis study asks: Why does resistance take place in some situations but not others? What conditions facilitated the emergence of collective armed resistance? While current theories of social movement emergence argue that collective action occurs when groups of individuals have opportunity, resources, and a sense of efficacy, this study will make a contribution by examining resistance under conditions of extreme repression, limited resources, and great despair.  This research will study Jewish victims of the Holocaust who are commonly portrayed as passive individuals. Yet well known cases of Jewish resistance such as the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising demonstrate that in at least some places, Jews did rise up against their oppressors. Jewish ghettos in Nazi-occupied Europe therefore provide a useful setting for an empirical study of the emergence of collective resistance under extreme circumstances. This project will make a contribution to the extant literature by examining an understudied context for collective action and use the results to develop new theoretical models. The investigator will conduct in-depth qualitative analysis and compare three strategically selected case studies: the Warsaw Ghetto (where collective Jewish resistance occurred), the Vilna Ghetto (where collective resistance was planned but not achieved), and the Lodz Ghetto (where collective resistance was never attempted). Data will include both primary and secondary sources, including transcripts from a random sample (N=120) of archived oral testimonies from survivors of each ghetto (40 from each ghetto). These testimonies are housed at the University of Southern California Shoah Foundation Institute. Oral testimony data will be analyzed using the qualitative software package NVivo.The study?s broader impacts are both educational and policy-related. First, the project will help contribute to extant knowledge about collective action and contentious politics in general. Although the results are intended primarily for professional academic audiences, they may also be used in other educational settings (e.g., Holocaust education in public schools). In addition, to the extent that they are disseminated more widely (e.g., through the media), the findings can also have an impact on the general public?s understanding of the Holocaust, especially by helping to dispel the myth of Jewish passivity. Lastly, the findings will have relevance to contemporary cases of resistance such as armed insurgencies, prison revolts and urban riots.","The  Mathematics Teacher Transformation Institutes  (MTTI) project is a research-based investigation of how leadership emerges and is expressed through mathematics knowledge, student-focused instructional practices, and influences on schools' mathematics outcomes.  In particular, this research is broadening the knowledge base on teaching and learning in mathematics through new understanding of how the study of conceptually-challenging mathematics, particularly in algebra and geometry, benefits second-stage teachers (4-10 years' experience); of how classroom-based action research contributes to critical and analytical understanding of the relationships between teaching practices and student learning; and of how multi-levels of support prepare second-stage teachers for leadership roles. To achieve these research objectives, the City University of New York (CUNY), Herbert H. Lehman College is partnering with New York City Department of Education Districts 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12.  Lehman College faculty in mathematics and mathematics education, staff of education centers and institutes who work in Bronx schools, and the Superintendents of Bronx districts work together to engage 80 experienced middle or high school teachers in the Bronx in 330 hours of professional development over 3 years to strengthen their leadership abilities, mathematics abilities, and educational practices.  These MTTI teacher participants are further supported on-site at their schools and through on-line discussion forums and are provided opportunities to showcase their work.  MTTI cultivates a professional network of mathematics teacher leaders who provide leadership to 200 additional middle and high school mathematics teachers as they enact a variety of roles including mentor, peer coach, presenter, conference participant/speaker, and active member of school curriculum and professional development teams.  Additionally, they participate in local and national discussions of current policy, practice, and research, and they develop informed understandings of the strengths and challenges of culturally and linguistically diverse classes.  Upon completion of the Institute, participants receive a Certificate for Secondary-School Mathematics Specialists through CUNY's School of Professional Studies of the Graduate School and University Center, registered with New York State Education Department.","Arizona State University (ASU) in collaboration with Phoenix Union High School District, Scottsdale Union High School District, Roosevelt District, Boys and Girls Club of the East Valley-Sacaton, Intel, Applied Learning Technologies Institute, Dynamic Educational Leadership for Teachers and Administrators (D.E.L.T.A.), ASU's School of Computing &amp; Informatics, ASU's Video Game Design Camp, and Arizona Council of Black Engineers and Scientists Computer Camp (ACBES), are conducting a culturally relevant multimedia program strategy, COMPUGIRLS. Drawing on three well-documented frameworks, Culturally Relevant Pedagogical practices (CRP), Social Justice Youth Development Framework, and Future Time Perspective, this after-school and summer program fosters in IT/STEM related outcomes for 100 adolescent (grades 8-12) girls from several Phoenix high needs districts and schools. COMPUGIRLS takes place at two sites, ASU and the Boys and Girls Club of the East Valley-Sacaton. Already, 40 girls have completed one-year of the program. This project expands the program to include another 60 students, their parents, ASU graduate students and in-service teachers, and peer mentors. COMPUGIRLS provides hands-on technology experiences that include internships, Advanced Placement credit, conference and community presentations, and parent workshops that will ultimately develop participants' techno-social analytic skills for real world problems.As part of their experience, students visit ASU. For many, this is the first time they have been on a college campus. Students participate in 6 multimedia courses: 1) social justice and the media, 2) SCRATCH, user-friendly computer programming, 3) modding SIMS, designing, modifying, and troubleshooting simplified simulations, 4) choice of 3-D, programming, and character design, 5) advanced choice of 3-D, programming, and character design, and 6) teamwork to create neighborhoods in Sim City using all skills learned. Participants' projects will be disseminated semi-annually through community ceremonies, web pages, and presentations.The project builds upon a pilot program (Summer 2007 to present) that accommodated 40 girls from under-resourced districts in the Phoenix metro area. The COMPUGIRLS program is a two-year curriculum using multimedia activities as a means of encouraging computational thinking. The project advances understanding of how to encourage girls (including girls from underrepresented groups) to pursue ICT fields. It builds upon established research and includes evaluation of the impact on participants' computational thinking, techno-social analytical skills, attitudes about and interest in pursuing further education and careers in ICT/STEM fields. The goals are:1) To use multimedia activities as a means of encouraging computational thinking; 2) To enhance girls' techno-social analytical skills; and 3) To provide the building blocks for Arizona girls from underrepresented groups to successfully traverse an ICT and/or any work force roadmap. The evaluation of the project consists of a mixed-methods approach (qualitative and quantitative), incorporating the use of survey instruments, student journals, focus groups, interviews, document review, observation and an intensive case study. A comparison/control group is incorporated into the pre- and post-test design to determine the extent the participants' skills, knowledge, attitudes and behaviors changed relative to where they would have been without participation in the project.","In most areas of human knowledge, the information revolution has resulted in a massive data explosion. The scale of data sets, their distributed and heterogeneous nature, and the need to quickly deliver results easily interpretable by non-experts, raise new theoretical and computational challenges for statistical learning, from variable selection and structural inference to visualization and online learning. This project uses sparse statistical inference as a powerful approach to meet these challenges. Its key insight is that seeking sparsity is a meaningful way of simultaneously stabilizing inference procedures, and highlighting structure in the underlying data. This work thus combines fundamental advances in sparse statistical learning with cutting-edge computational tools from mathematical programming to create a new framework for structural knowledge discovery in large-scale, streaming data sets. It is focused on two fundamental themes in sparse inference: variable selection and structural inference. Variable selection seeks to isolate a few key variables from high dimensional data sets and is a fundamental preprocessing tool in statistical learning. Structural inference then aims to consistently identify a few core dependence relationships among these variables to highlight its structure. From a computational point of view, many recent results in machine learning have relied on advanced methods from convex optimization such as semidefinite programming and robust optimization and this project seeks to improve the complexity of these algorithms and their capacity to handle very-large scale, streaming data.  In practice, this project is motivated by the desire to help the public understand our democracies by analyzing large-scale political and social data sets, with a particular focus on voting records, online news sources, and polling data. Its approach is to apply statistical inference principles to social sciences, using collaborations with experts in political science and economics to forge the models and techniques under study. In carrying out the research, this project will be training graduate students from statistics, electrical engineering/financial engineering into interdisciplinary researchers at the interface of statistics, optimization, and subject matter areas such as finance and political science. In addition we plan to develop a web site, accessible first to a restricted set of social science researchers, to allow them to analyze mid-sized corpora of online news in text format, in the form of say, sparse graphs of words showing statistical associations between given keywords. The PIs plan to develop a software toolbox implementing these results, interfaced with common numerical packages such as MATLAB, R or python as well as an undergraduate course on ``Statistical Analysis of Online Data  at Berkeley and Princeton, incorporating some of the material produced in this project into the course program.","Lead Partner:  Michigan Technological UniversityCore Partner: Grand Rapids Public Schools (GRPS)Supporting Partners: Grand Rapids Area Pre-College Engineering Program (GRAPCEP), Midwest National Parks, Cass Technical High School, American Geological Institute, Grand Valley State University Geology Department, Kalamazoo Area Mathematics and Science Center   Michigan Teaching Excellence Program (MITEP) is a multi-year program of teacher leadership development that empowers middle-grade science teachers to lead their schools and districts through the process of systematically improving science teaching and learning. The project uses Earth Systems Science(ESS)content and inquiry-based instructional practices to emphasize themes that unite all sciences and mathematics. MITEP includes both summer and academic-year components, and uses a variety of on-site, residential, field, distance, and in-service delivery methods. Components promote leadership skills, collaboration, urban place-based inquiry, access to cutting-edge data and materials, technology, engagement of diverse learners, study of key scientific concepts that cross disciplinary boundaries, pedagogical innovation. The project will also implement and test lessons and units that challenge students and prepare them for further science study. Teachers receive stipends and credit as incentive for participating in the project and testing its approach to reform.    The project is based on the premise that successful reform depends on the full involvement of teachers who have the skills to lead their colleagues through the process of developing and implementing new instructional approaches. MITEP teacher-leaders and research university faculty are full partners in the process. Teacher-leaders are at the forefront of their schools' and district's efforts to evaluate, design, implement, and test new inquiry-based instructional programs. MITEP teacher-leaders help develop common pacing schedules and  course assessments. They assist with planning  professional development activities and providing ongoing assistance to colleagues. MITEP teacher-leaders are encouraged to disseminate information about the project through presentations at state and national conferences, to submit papers for publication.     Teacher-led reform is strongly supported by the administration of the core school district partner as an innovative way to generate enthusiasm for curricular and instructional change. To encourage development of leadership skills, school administrators give teacher-leaders progressively increased responsibility for strengthening curriculum, improving instructional strategies, and designing assessments. District administrators are providing the resources required for teachers' success in implementing and coordinating the project by assisting with the selection of teachers with exceptional leadership qualities for participation in MITEP;assisting in the design of professional development activities that meet the needs of teachers and their students; providing flexibility in teachers' schedules; utilizing middle-grade teachers' expertise in the dissemination of information to primary and high-school teachers; recognizing, rewarding, and encouraging teachers who serve as leaders; fostering growth of a teacher network; and creating a district-wide atmosphere that nurtures teacher-led reform efforts.","IMPACT MECHANICS AND CENTRAL PIT FORMATION ON ICY SATELLITES Central pit craters are an unusual morphological class of impact crater seen most commonly on the large icy satellites Ganymede and Callisto where they replace the peak-ring morphology expected","The number of scientific journals and the number of papers published in those journals is increasing at a fast pace: currently, there are roughly 9,000 scientific journals, a twenty-fold increase from the 400 scientific journals available in 1955. The size and growth of the research literature places a tremendous burden on decision-making agents, such as funding agencies, university administrators, and reviewers, who have to evaluate the quality of research of individuals and institutions in a fast and efficient manner. In addition, the evaluation of individuals and institutions relies heavily on the assessment of the ultimate impact of published research, typically measured as the number of publications or the number of citations. Despite the oversimplification of using just a few numbers to quantify the scientific merit of a body of research, the entire science and technology community is relying more and more on citation-based statistics as a tool for evaluating the research performance of individuals and institutions and the development of tools that facilitate the evaluation task is crucial in order to ensure the highest quality standard for funded research.A major challenge is that stakeholders often want an estimate of the impact of a paper long before citations start to accumulate. This project aims precisely at facilitating such a task by developing tools to predict, soon after publication, the ultimate impact of research. This project uses longitudinal data available for papers published since 1955, drawing upon the concept that one can infer patterns of citation accumulation from large-scale analysis of historical data. Broader Impact: The outcome of this research is of relevance to decision makers that are called on to evaluate the productivity of researchers and institutions, as well as the impact of their work. The goal of this project is to develop transparent statistically-sound methods in order to enable institutions and funding agencies to make better informed decisions based on an objective assessment of the impact of published research.","IMPROVED NUMERICAL MODELING OF GAS-SURFACE INTERACTION IN HYPERSONIC FLOWS  A modification to the NASA DPLR code is proposed to improve the capability of the tool to simulate detailed gas/surface interaction chemistry on TPS materials for applications to","The Kentucky (KY) EPSCoR RII-7 proposal unites eight institutions, University of Kentucky, Berea College, Centre College of Kentucky, Kentucky State University, Morehead State University, Northern Kentucky University, University of Louisville, and Eastern Kentucky University, to continue the strategy of investing in infrastructure to develop Kentucky?s ?New Economy? by supporting research in Innovative Materials and Devices.  Intellectual Merit This project will pursue two major research initiatives. Initiative in Innovative Materials and Devices is focused on studies of bulk single-crystal transition metal oxides and epitaxial thin films with complementary functionalities, and applications of multilayered thin films for molecular electrodes as well as for single-molecule magnets. The other part of the project will focus on engineering new platforms to enhance our understanding of a single cell or multiple cell types, interactions between individual cells and cell types, and sensing at the molecular, intracellular and intercellular levels. A statewide Micro/Nano Network will advance micro/nanotechnology and the many fields that utilize this technology.Broader ImpactsKentucky EPSCoR has developed a comprehensive plan for increasing diversity and evaluating progress in that area.  Programs such as seed-funding that supports research at regional institutions and a program to involve diverse populations of Kentucky students in research will be supported through EPSCoR.  A special program for computer science graduate students at Kentucky State University will be introduced.  Kentucky EPSCoR also proposes the cyberinfrastructure plans for the state, and augments them with support for increasing the expertise and developing new sources of talent. The project is consistent with the state?s science and technology plan, and the associated higher education plan.  The project will develop new facilities and establish new faculty and staff positions in the bio-, nano-, &amp; cyber-technology areas.  Kentucky EPSCoR has developed a review process intended to identify infrastructure that should support the most promising research.  A system of evaluation metrics has been developed to determine whether a strategy is working, and if it is improving Kentucky?s competitiveness.","The Milwaukee Mathematics Partnership (MMP) began in 2003 with the aim of improving mathematics achievement for the students in the Milwaukee Public Schools and increasing students' success in transitioning to college mathematics. The University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, the Milwaukee Public Schools, and the Milwaukee Area Technical College have solidified their continued commitment as core partners to this unique collaboration among a large urban district, a four-year urban university, and a two-year technical college. Student achievement has increased in most grade levels with an accompanying decrease in the gap between state and district proficiency. Evaluations indicate that building school capacity through a math framework and distributed leadership via school learning teams and math teacher leaders is associated with improved student achievement.Phase II will investigate three specific research topics. The first topic involves continued study of the impact of distributed leadership through varied mathematics teacher leader models on school professional communities and on student achievement. The MMP initiated a no-release time model of teacher leaders and is transitioning to a partial-release time model with funds from the Office of the Wisconsin Governor. A second area of research is the transition of students to post-secondary mathematics. The MMP will study the impact of a new district post-secondary mathematics readiness exam on high school course enrollments and post-secondary placements into remedial and non-remedial courses. The third area is focuses on the development of mathematical knowledge for teaching in preservice teachers, teacher leaders, and classroom teachers and will examine the relationship of this knowledge to teacher leader practice, instructional practice, and student learning.","The research objective is the theoretical and practical design and implementation of new computational data models and query languages for the trajectories (both historical and predicted) of moving objects in both constrained and unconstrained environments. One aspect is to include the modeling and querying of current and predictive movement (e.g., the prediction of the future evolution of hurricanes and wild fires) into databases. This especially introduces the inherent feature of uncertainty of moving objects, incorporates the database support of prediction models independent of applications, and includes a homogeneous and seamless integration of both historical and predictive moving objects in unconstrained environments that allow free movement. Another aspect relates to the special situation of moving objects in constrained environments, and here especially in spatial networks (like vehicles in transportation networks). The main issues here are how spatial networks as well as moving objects in them can be designed, queried, and implemented within a database system. The solution approach is based on three fundamental algebras or type systems that are embedded into database systems: (i) the Moving Balloon Algebra (MBA) for predictive moving objects in unconstraint environments, (ii) the Network Algebra (NETALG) for geometric networks in spatial databases, and (iii) the Moving Object in Network (MONET) Algebra for moving objects in spatial networks. The resuls of this research are expected to have applications in areas where dynamically evolving spatial objects -- which change their location, shape, and extent over time -- play a role. Examples are meteorology, hurricane research, fire management, disaster management, navigation systems, environmental monitoring, transportation and distribution, emergency services, telecommunications, to name only a few.

TurekianHRD 0850461With National Science Foundation support, the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) will support the National Research Foundation?s (NRF) South African Ph.D. Project by serving as a key collaborator in planning an interdisciplinary science and engineering capacity building conference in South Africa for the NRF?s Ph.D. students worldwide.  The conference will provide opportunities to forge relationships between South African scientists and students, their counterparts at NSF CREST institutions in the U.S. and other members of the larger science communities in the U.S. and beyond.  This NSF award will enable AAAS to support the intellectual development of the conference and travel by U.S.-based scientists and students to the meeting in South Africa.  AAAS will serve a key collaborator in planning the scientific conference, developing the framework for the meeting, and through an advisory role, helping to build long term capacity to organize and conduct such meeting ? conveying best practices in the organization and execution of an interdisciplinary scientific conference and providing adaptable templates for conference materials.Intellectual MeritThe proposed conference will provide significant educational and professional development experiences for the participating students from South Africa and the United States while providing in-person contact between U.S. and South African scientists that could facilitate future scientific collaborations among and between the participating scientists.Broader ImpactsThe proposed conference should significantly enhance the educational and professional development of the participating U.S. and South African students as well as facilitate the development of both institutional and faculty research collaborations between the participating U.S. and South African institutions and scientists.","SES-0818337Meredith Kleykamp   University of KansasThe project will measure whether employers exhibit discriminatory or preferential attitudes toward military veterans and whether this affects veteran treatment in the hiring process. This study explores how and why veteran outcomes differ by race/ethnicity and gender. The main goals of the project are to: 1) identify how military veterans fare in hiring, document the extent of differential hiring treatment of veterans and whether such treatment varies by race and gender using an experimental design 2) explore the mechanisms explaining employer  treatment of veterans, how employers evaluate military experience, and what meaning military experience holds in the civilian hiring process using in-depth interviews with hiring agents and 3) adjudicate competing sociological explanations for differential veteran/nonveteran employment outcomes, of human capital development, selection, signaling or screening, and cultural capital development on the basis of the audit and interview data.  Broader ImpactsThe research has broad reaching social impacts.  First, it contributes to both the academic and practical understanding of veteran hiring practices. Findings will foster development of veteran-friendly transition and employment policies.  Evidence of discriminatory hiring practices or negative sentiments toward military job seekers would suggest the need for better employer education on laws protecting military members and better evaluation of compliance with such laws.  On the other hand, evidence of preferential treatment could clarify that employment transition difficulties facing veterans lie elsewhere in the hiring or job matching process.   The project contributes to the recent University of Kansas-Ft. Leavenworth initiative facilitating collaboration between the University and the Army?s Command and General Staff College by providing information that can be used to aid military policymaking.","X-Ray Flares: The Last Breath of the Inner Engine Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB) explosions occur approximately three times per day in the visible universe (not considering the beaming correction) and have been observed routinely by highly successful dedicated mis","Immigration is a major area of concern shaping contemporary policy, practice and debate in the United States. As a large scale agent of change, shifts in policy and perceptions concerning immigrants ripple through social networks, affecting household arrangements and resources that impact not only individuals, but families and whole communities. These impacts are felt by immigrants, naturalized citizens and natives who share the same communities, households and families. Recent research suggests that social networks among the urban poor can be eroded by macro-level economic and political uncertainty and instability, but comparatively little is known about how this process unfolds. Clear scientific evidence demonstrating how people are affected by such policy shifts can provide evidence for developing immigration-related policy and practice with fewer negative unintended consequences. With backgrounds in sociology, anthropology, human biology, geography and demography, the project team examined Latino households with at least one Spanish-speaking adult in south Phoenix, Arizona. Households were recruited by partnering with Latino community educators who are well-established in the area. Field interviews were conducted by bilingual students at Arizona State University. Using a range of tools and methods, including social network analysis and mathematical modeling, researchers determined if and how the households reorganized in response to changing immigration policy and practice. The study examined the social networks that link household members to each other and larger networks, and model the implications of this for the resource flows to household members and ultimately for household resiliency and the well-being of family members. Agent-based models were then applied to examine the potential impact of future large-scale shifts in immigration perceptions and policies.By focusing on the mechanism of social networks?as the framework in which decisions concerning resource flows are made, played out, and constrained?the study empirically ties well-being of household members to social policy shifts outside the household in new and more explicit ways. The project?s unique approach to data construction makes it possible to clarify the potential for changes in immigration enforcement or employer sanction laws to impact individuals who may or may not be directly targeted by these policies. At the local level, the data, findings, and related outreach activities will contribute to the development of research capacities within the target community and raise public awareness. Research findings, such as determining which factors enhance household stability and how social networks can be leveraged to move limited resources where they are most needed, were shared with local stakeholders to support their goals of building healthy communities.","THE CENTER FOR RADIATION ENGINEERING AND SCIENCE FOR SPACE EXPLORATION (CRESSE) Prairie View A&amp;M University (PVAMU) - a HBCU - proposes a research center with the infrastructure to investigate the scientific and engineering challenges faced by NASA and th","ENHANCING THE USE OF NASA EARTH SCIENCE RESULTS / DATA / AND TECHNOLOGY BY ENGAGING THE FEDERATION OF EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATION PARTNERS COMMUNITIES OF PRACTICE IN TARGET AREAS OF INTEREST TO NASA The Federation of Earth Science Information Partners ( Fed","The period between the late-Pleistocene glacial maximum and the early-Holocene thermal maximum (ca. 21,000 to 7,000 years ago) was a time of dramatic environmental change and biotic adjustments. The creation of new ecosystems in deglaciated regions was governed by the rate of ice recession, the nature of postglacial climate change, the characteristics of new landscapes, and the life-history traits of the biologic colonizers.The Yellowstone region supported the largest independent ice field in the western U.S., and ice recession after 17 cal ka set in motion a sequence of poorly-documented biologic events that ultimately led to the present-day terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. This examination of the late-glacial and early-Holocene periods in the Yellowstone region poses the following questions: What are the primary controls of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystem development on newly created landscapes? Specifically, how are past biota influenced by intrinsic biological constraints, landscape evolution, and subregional climate differences during a period of dramatic climate change? The study tests hypotheses concerning the importance of climatic and nonclimatic drivers in ecosystem development through an examination of lake-sediment records from sites that (1) lie along the path of ice recession, (2) span a variety of substrates, and (3) are situated within summer-wet and summer-dry precipitation regimes.  Yellowstone is an ideal region to examine the development and structuring of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, because (1) the climate history of the western US is reasonably well understood from prior data syntheses and paleoclimate model simulations; (2) a well-documented glacial history of the Yellowstone region offers independent information on local environmental change; (3) different substrates and precipitation regimes shape modern ecosystem distributions and likely have in the past as well; and (4) previous paleoecologic findings motivate more-nuanced research questions that can be addressed with the acquisition of new high-resolution records.Intellectual Merit of the Research: Understanding the biotic consequences of climatic change is a major challenge in Earth systems research and identified as a high priority in recent international and US climate change assessments. The proposed study builds on existing knowledge of Yellowstone's past in an effort to better understand the resilience of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems to environmental change, including abrupt climate events of the magnitude projected in the future. This project adopts a stratified sampling approach that is not possible in most locations where paleobiotic data are sparse, and the information gained will help answer basic biologic questions about the importance of abiotic and biotic variables in modulating the effects of climate change on species, communities, and ecosystems. The resulting synthesis will be a critical step in bridging the gap between current understanding of ecological processes on short time scales and evidence of dramatic change preserved in paleoecologic data on long time scales.Broader Impacts of the Research lie in its contribution to ongoing efforts that better inform the public, land and resource managers, and students about the importance of environmental history in the national parks, including an understanding of past climate change and ecosystem sensitivity. This project in particular, extends outreach activities in a number of ways, among them regularly updated web-disseminated information by the National Park Service on Yellowstone's history; education and training activities for Park staff on cutting-edge paleoclimate research; incorporation of Yellowstone findings in Park-directed K-12 curricula and university coursework; publication in popular scientific magazines; and content for a new museum exhibit on Yellowstone. The project also continues the PIs' commitment to train and educate the next generation of diverse scientists and to contribute to ongoing efforts to build multidisciplinary paleoclimate datasets for use by researchers, land managers, educators, and the public.","The Materials Research Science and Engineering Center (MRSEC) at the University of Nebraska supports an interdisciplinary research program on Quantum and Spin Phenomena in Nanomagnetic Structures (QSPINS).  The MRSEC's research is centered on studies of new magnetic materials and structures at the nanometer scale, with the aim of developing fundamental understanding of their properties and related phenomena important for advanced technological applications.  QSPINS is organized into two interdisciplinary research groups (IRGs). IRG1 'Nanoscale Magnetism: Structures, Materials and Phenomena' focuses on fundamental physics, chemistry, and materials issues in nanoscale magnets, addressing important quantum, electronic structure, nanofabrication, high-sensitivity measurements, and magnetization-dynamics problems.  Nanostructuring has reached a length scale where quantum approaches are needed, and this IRG brings a unique combination of theory, modeling, and new fabrication and measurement methods to the study of novel materials and phenomena.  The expected outcomes are new insights into phenomena and structures important for the development of novel cluster-assembled materials, higher energy-density permanent magnets, and information-technology materials. IRG2 'Magnetoelectric Interfaces and Spin Transport' employs the electron spin in a synergistic combination with novel nanoscale magnetic and ferroelectric structures to manipulate spin-dependent properties to yield new scientific concepts and achieve enhanced functionalities. Designed magnetoelectric and piezomagnetic heterostructures are to be investigated where the interplay between electricity, elasticity, and magnetism across interfaces manifests interesting unexplored phenomena, such as electrically-controlled exchange bias and magneto-crystalline anisotropy, and ferroelectrically-tailored spin transport. QSPINS's education and outreach programs encourage gifted young people to pursue scientific careers, broaden the participation of underrepresented groups in science through targeted programs, and improve materials literacy among the general public.  As an integral part of the Center, QSPINS offers interdisciplinary training for the next generation of materials scientists and engineers by providing regional four-year institutions experience and tools to improve their materials science programs and curricula, offering opportunities for middle- and high-school teachers and their students to learn about materials science, and by addressing pre-college segments of the educational pipeline via targeted outreach activities.  QSPINS maintains shared experimental and computational facilities and supports exploratory Seed Projects to provide continual revitalization of the projects and investigators and promote new interdisciplinary collaborations. QSPINS fosters interactions with industrial companies to leverage the expected scientific innovations for potential technological advances.","PI: David Hannapel (Iowa State University)CoPIs: Aragula G. Rao (Iowa State University), Jeff Coller (Case Western Reserve University), William J. Lucas (University of California, Davis)Plants perceive outside signals that activate pathways to control their defenses and growth. The length of daylight or photoperiod is a key signal that regulates growth processes like flowering in many plants and tuber formation in potato. Tuber formation in potato involves the transport of a light-activated signal from the leaf to the underground organ, the potato tuber. The overall scientific objective of this project is to study the range of signals that are responsible for controlling tuber formation. Signals involved in this process include both proteins and RNA. Two research goals will be addressed in this project: 1) To identify and characterize RNAs of potato that are transported from the leaf to the underground tuber and 2) To identify proteins that work with the RNAs to facilitate this transport. Several approaches will be undertaken to implement these research goals, including the systematic characterization of the network of RNAs and proteins present in this transport system. Proteins and RNAs will be identified and tested for their function in this signaling system. The primary goal of this project is to understand how this collection of signals regulates tuber formation. The utility of this research activity is that the information generated by these experiments will have direct applications for enhancing crop productivity. The broader scientific impacts resulting from this research activity are inherent in the enhancement of our understanding of how plants use light signals to control their growth and, for agronomic crops, to affect their yield. A significant component of this project is the educational and outreach features. The educational component will be implemented through the Summer Internship program that will provide high school and undergraduate students with the opportunity to participate in plant biology projects. As a component of outreach training, summer internships for high school biology teachers will also be offered. These teachers will work with project leaders on the Iowa State, UC-Davis, or Case Western Reserve campuses to learn more about plant biology. By targeting high school teachers who may teach up to 100 students a year, the influence of this program will be greatly expanded and will fulfill a primary mission of NSF; to communicate to society the significance of the outcomes of current research in plant biology. The international component of this project will expand the breadth of training available through this initiative and enhance global awareness of the scientific challenges addressed in this research. This project includes ample opportunities for participation by women and underrepresented groups in laboratory research. Project outcomes will be made available to the scientific community through a project website, which will be accessible via http://www.hort.iastate.edu/research/research-detail.php?id=1148.","The project proposes a conference to stimulate a national conversation on new STEM learning research paradigms that cut across boundaries and investigate multiple contexts and media, rather than historical approaches that have viewed learning within limited temporal, spatial and socio-cultural contexts.The project will create a special peer-reviewed, international themed issue in the journal Science Education that reflects the meeting, convene the national conference of prominent learning sciences researchers, host a post-conference national web conference, follow-up on participants after one year, and host a series of national discussions around new paradigms in STEM at multiple national meetings.","TRACKING PLAGIOCLASE AND HIGH-CA PYROXENE AS INDICATORS OF THE PATHOGENESIS OF ASTEROIDS 433 EROS This project entitled Tracking Plagioclase and High-Ca Pyroxene As Indicators of the Petrogenesis of Asteroid 433 Eros  aims to try to better understand the","This project examines the information seeking and using behaviors of decision makers who face decisions about their future R&amp;D investments.   A number of trends have made these decisions more uncertain, notably  Open Innovation,  the globalization of science and technology, increasingly diverse sources of technical and scientific information, as well as the global outsourcing of research to developing economies.  There is substantial evidence that industrial decision makers lack needed information; are unaware of available information; or need a more inclusive model of appropriate decision processes.  The study sheds light on whether and why industry decision makers choose global R&amp;D over U.S. R&amp;D.  It does this by examining how firms that are global innovators use information about scientific and technical resources, together with other innovation-related data, to shape their investment decisions and competitive strategies.  The project is based on collaboration with the Center for Innovation Management Studies and the Industrial Research Institute (IRI), whose 250 members collectively fund and conduct about 75% of U.S. industrial research. These firms' day-to-day R&amp;D investment decisions are transforming traditional company-owned R&amp;D laboratories into the  Laboratory of the Future  (LOF). Each firm's own  LOF  may consist of a traditional laboratory, a collaborative laboratory, a virtual laboratory or a network of external resources, including university researchers in the U.S. or abroad, as well as government or private labs, collaborative strategic partners, or simulation tools thus augmenting or even replacing company owned physical labs. LOFs are highly likely to vary by industry and by the competitive environment of the firm. The study examines participants' discussions of these decisions and the information resources they use to decide how to build their future innovation capabilities. The project analyzes the LOF discussion to reveal how R&amp;D managers think long-term and strategically about what they do.  The project documents information seeking and information using behavior as exhibited in an on-line discussion by the decision makers about the R&amp;D  LOF . In addition the research opens a window into decision makers' rationales for their investment commitments.Broader Impacts: Corporate R&amp;D executives are making decisions now that will, in the aggregate, shape the LOF and affect U.S. national innovation system. This project documents how they are making those decisions, what information they are presently using, and what kinds of data might be desirable for robust decisions. The project results inform both decision makers in industry and policy makers about data and information sources presently used, not used, and data not presently available but desirable for the future.","NEBRASKA MATH is to improve achievement for all students and narrow achievement gaps among at-risk populations by focusing on three key transition points along the mathematics continuum: the mathematics education of children in transition from kindergarten through early primary to grade 3; the algebra transition from middle to high school and the transition of new secondary math teachers from certification to the classroom.  The project is focused on four strategies; (i) Developing an active and mature partnership (sustained through state dollars after the end of NSF funding) by linking mathematics teachers and school administrators from across Nebraska with university mathematicians and mathematics educators and early childhood educators to improve mathematics education statewide; (ii) Strengthening the mathematical and pedagogical knowledge for teaching of participating teachers and their professional interactions with other teachers in their schools, while improving their attitudes to the teaching and learning of mathematics; (iii) Improving students' competence, beliefs and attitudes about mathematics, their appreciation of the importance of sustained effort, and their knowledge of mathematics; and (iv)) Contributing to the research in mathematics education through a mixed methods research design studying K-3 teacher's knowledge, attitudes, and leadership in relation to student disposition and achievement.A goal of the project is to create a model partnership, both on the University of Nebraska-Lincoln (UNL) campus and nationally, where faculty in an academic discipline (in this case mathematics) and faculty in education work with teachers and administrators from the K-12 education community, sharing expertise and resources in pursuit of a world class mathematics education system.  NEBRASKA MATH partners the University of Nebraska-Lincoln with four school districts and 15 Educational Service Units (ESUs), in rural Nebraska, which provide support to 63 additional school districts.  The intent is to form a permanent K-16 mathematics partnership that is sustained primarily by local dollars.  Over the five years the project is to impact 900 teachers (750 at the elementary level and 150 at the secondary level) and approximately 60,000 students.","The period between the late-Pleistocene glacial maximum and the early-Holocene thermal maximum (ca. 21,000 to 7,000 years ago) was a time of dramatic environmental change and biotic adjustments.

Models of climate-driven geographic speciation were developed for many groups of temperate organisms, and a particularly detailed and explicit speciation model was developed for North American birds. Over the last decade, this paradigm for North American birds has become the topic of debate, and so a comprehensive understanding of how temperate zone birds were impacted by past environmental change events remains elusive. This project will directly test the paradigm and will significantly extend understanding of the history of the fauna of pine and oak woodlands. The work will use state-of-the-art molecular techniques and analyses to examine the temporal and spatial patterns of diversification of North American birds in relation to past environmental change and will produce a multi-locus comparative phylogeography of pine and oak woodland birds. The project provides significant mentoring and research opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students, including many students from underrepresented groups, and gives these students a unique opportunity to work in a multi-institutional and multidisciplinary research effort between a small rural university and two large urban research universities.

The project also partners with the Ironwood Observatory and Education Center in Hawaii, the James Cook Universtiy Center for Astronomy in Australia and the NASA Stennis Space Center in Mississippi. The focus of the partnership is on high school physics, chemistry and earth science. The project anticipates enabling 45 preservice teachers to obtain teaching licenses in high school science. Courses will be designed and taught by the College of Education and Human Development and the College of Science, Engineering and Technology. The project will provide 200 inservice teachers with 160 hours of professional development. The goal is to enable teachers to implement National Science Education Standards and the Mississippi Science Curriculum Frameworks for high school (9-12) education. The long term goal is to improve student achievement in science and to significantly reduce achievement gaps in the science performance within the diverse student population. The inservice component consists of two compressed 3 credit hours graduate courses. Each course will be taught in 10 days (20 days total), two weeks in summer and 10 Saturdays during the academic year. The emphasis will be on conceptual development for each major topic and will include coursework, inquiry-based laboratory work, demonstrations, hands-on activities, and problem solving with special emphasis on using technology as tools of instruction.

The investigators are targeting to devise means of employing instead lignocellulosic biomaterials (biocarbons) that originate naturally from within America.  The team will build on their recently-devised means of functionalizing the porous biocarbons with reduced-nitrogen groups that remove perchlorate and other oxyanions.

The results from the assessment phase inform the public and private sector about locational investments in science and engineering (S&amp;E) activities occurring on URPs.  URPs have been an important element of our national innovation system for nearly half a century, and in 2007 the  Building a Stronger America Act  (S. 1373) was introduced in Congress under the stated premise that it is in the best interests of the Nation to encourage the formation of new parks and the expansion of existing parks in order to promote the clustering of innovation through high technology activities.  Surprisingly, very little research has been undertaken on science/research parks, in general, or URPs, in particular.  And, no research has been undertaken on the innovation benefits realized by firms that locate on U.S. parks.  This project broadens our understanding of URPs as a component of our national innovation system; develops an assessment tool for assessing the innovation benefits realized by firms as a result of locating on a park; collects relevant data to implement this methodology and offers empirically-based statements on realized innovation benefits from on-park research synergies; and offers prospective statements about the organizational structure of URPs that will be most conducive to enhancing the research synergies among park firms on new or expanded parks.BROADER IMPACTS:  The main intellectual outputs from this research are an assessment of the innovative performance of, and research outputs from, on-park firms relative to comparable firms that are not located on a park.  As such, this project's broader impacts include, from a national perspective, the development of park-based science metrics and policy prescriptions to enhance university-driven S&amp;E-based economic development through park formations and park growth.  And, from a private-sector perspective, this project informs the locational consideration, and hence future research efficiency, of firms' S&amp;E investments.  The project's resulting science metrics inform the consideration of new innovation indicators specifically related to parks.  The project's policy prescriptions inform not only Congressional deliberations related to the  Building a Stronger America Act  but also future state and regional S&amp;E investment considerations for building new UPRs and/or expanding existing ones.","Abstract For nearly a century, biologists have debated whether past climate change promoted speciation in temperate zone organisms.

The series is focused on climate, weather, and water processes and issues that are particularly relevant to American Indian communities and tribal lands and is expected to provide a foundation for TCU students interested in climate change.  The courses are being designed to provide American Indian and other students the opportunity to gain a thorough understanding of the physical, cultural, and technological issues associated with climate change and the mitigation of its effects on the earth and its people.  The course series has two components.  The first is a semester-long undergraduate climate change science course taught from the perspective of the traditional ecological knowledge held by Native peoples of North America.  The second is an Indigenous-based research practicum using Cyberinfrastructure-enabled access to Geosciences data, instrumentation and computing resource that provides an opportunity for Tribal College students to practice state-of-the-art e-Science, in collaboration with elders, community members, and research mentors at NCAR.   The project is being evaluated using the NSF-supported Indigenous Framework for STEM evaluation and should result in a program that can be used throughout all TCUs and other institutions of higher education.","For the vast majority of human history, people all over the world have lived in small social groups as hunters and gatherers, and not in towns or villages. Agriculture has been claimed to be the driving force for recent population expansions: in the strongest claims, almost all current language families ultimately have their pre-industrial distribution because of agricultural expansion. While the spread of farming and languages associated with it has claimed a lot of recent attention, there has been very little corresponding work on the languages of hunter-gatherers. It is important for our overall understanding of social dynamics to analyze what drives change and spread among hunter-gatherers and determine whether such processes are different from what occurred after the farming revolution, 10,000 years ago. Researchers from the US, Canada, New Zealand and Australia will collaborate on work comparing hunter-gatherer groups on three continents (North America, South America, and Australia). In North and South America, some hunter-gatherer languages have spread over large distances, but farming and associated languages have also spread widely, and in some cases farmers reverted to foraging. In Australia, the transition to farming never took place but one language family spread very widely. Results from genetics, linguistics, anthropology and archaeology will be combined to clarify what the relative contributions of migration and language shift were to language spreads. Among the linguistic data to be collected are vocabulary in the fields of plants and animals, and kinship and social organization.","Mathematics (21) This collaborative project addresses a problem that occurs in many mathematics and mathematics-related courses at the university-level across the US: high failure rates in important early college mathematics courses, especially in Calculus I. The teaching strategy being used and tested is based on the idea of using Enhanced Conceptual Development through Focused Oral Discourse, or Orals. The current work is analyzing and extending  earlier work that has been focused on helping students identified as at risk of failing calculus. Based on the earlier success of reducing failure rates using effective teaching strategies, including Orals, the project team is now applying these teaching strategies to diverse users in several new settings: to classes taught in different STEM (science, technology engineering, and mathematics) departments, at a different college, and at different educational levels. The goals of this project are to: 1) Refine, implement, and test Orals with diverse groups of learners and in diverse education settings; 2) Provide training, coaching and evaluation for facilitators of Orals including Instructors, Teaching Assistants and Undergraduate Learning Assistants; 3) Provide extensive assessment artifacts of the implementations; 4) Create a database and website of new learning materials (Orals questions for diverse courses); and 5) Improve the retention and understanding of STEM students. Intellectual Merit: The importance of discourse in the mathematical sciences classroom has already been shown for K-12. A potentially important impact of this proposal will be to contribute to the national dialogue by conducting careful experiments that assess one method of increasing discourse: Orals. In particular, the project team will conduct proof of concept studies of Orals, in moving from small classrooms (the original setting) to large lecture sections. Broader Impact: Many STEM majors require successful completion of a calculus sequence; however, many university students do not achieve their career goals because of their inability to pass the introductory calculus courses. This project will address this important national issue. The new work will not only be in a larger variety of mathematics courses, but also in introductory Aerospace and Mechanical Engineering courses, and at a local high school in a two-year algebra course.","This is a five-year project aimed at organizing a DRK-12 Resource Network to provide assistance for projects in areas such as research and development methods, implementation, and analysis procedures; synthesis of findings across the portfolio of projects; and national dissemination of the R&amp;D contributions of the DRK-12 program. To accomplish these goals, Education Development Center (EDC) will join efforts with Abt Associates Inc., and Policy Studies Associates to implement three major strands: (1) Technical Assistance, which consists of (a) a portfolio assessment to define it in terms of composition and major characteristics and identify project needs, (b) individual technical work services to project leadership, (c) focus groups, (d) thematic meetings, (e) Principal Investigators (PI) meetings, and (f) a web portal; (2) Portfolio Analysis, including (a) synthesis activities to capture a comprehensive view of the portfolio in order to understand the role that the program has played in advancing K-12 student and teacher learning, and (b) evaluative studies of selected projects describing specific contributions to the field; and (3) Dissemination, comprising (a) the development of a white paper to summarize research findings on dissemination and implementation of research in practice and policy settings and highlight examples from the portfolio, and (b) a series of dissemination-related workshops.","This Phase I CCI will place chemistry at the center of research efforts to describe the molecular composition of the universe. The Center for Chemistry of the Universe will assemble a multi-institutional, multidisciplinary group of researchers to investigate and understand chemical processes in the interstellar medium. The chemistry occurring under the unique conditions of the interstellar medium produces the initial molecular starting materials for solar system formation. This chemistry, which produces a surprisingly rich set of common organic molecules along with more exotic reactive species, also supplies the molecules in meteorites and comets that may deliver the building blocks of life to young planets. Understanding this chemistry will require the development of high-speed broadband mm-wave spectrophotometers for chemical identification as well as new methods to probe chemical reactivity in cold gases and on surfaces. The Center will establish connections between fields such as combustion chemistry, atmospheric chemistry, and materials processing that share the theme of  chemistry under extreme conditions.  The Center will provide a team-oriented, collaborative and multidisciplinary research environment for graduate student and postdoctoral researchers. Synergistic center activities capitalize on the broad appeal of the space sciences and include a summer undergraduate research program, a university-level general science course, new web materials for the general public and display materials for out-of-school time programs in science centers and museums.The Centers for Chemical Innovation (CCI) Program supports research centers that can address major, long-term fundamental chemical research challenges that have a high probability of both producing transformative research and leading to innovation.  These Centers will attract broad scientific and public interest.","Bacteria, fungi and a suite of other microorganisms are the engines that drive many essential soil processes. They recycle the nutrients that all plants depend upon, they decompose organic materials that would otherwise accumulate, and they convert soil organic matter to carbon dioxide (CO2). Thus, though invisible to the naked eye, soil microbes can influence a suite of global processes, including atmospheric composition and global climate. While the importance of microbial processes is clear, much less is known about the types or numbers of organisms that are responsible for carrying out within-soil processes. This is particularly true for tropical rain forests, the most diverse biomes on land. In this project, a suite of techniques, observations and experiments will be applied to examine the factors that regulate soil microbial community composition, and to determine how seasonal changes in tropical rain forest ecosystems are related to changes in soil microbial communities.  An improved understanding of decomposition and CO2 fluxes in tropical forests is relevant to a variety of societal issues, as they play a major role in regulating global carbon and nutrient cycles, atmospheric chemistry, and climate. This proposal will provide critical support for two junior scientists early in their careers, as well as graduate and undergraduate students. It also will advance collaborations with Costa Rican scientists and contribute to outreach, conservation and management goals in southwestern Costa Rica via established partnerships with a local nongovernmental organization and a National Park stakeholder organization.","DRL- 0813135Communicating Climate ChangePI: Walter StavelozABSTRACTThe Association of Science-Technology Centers (ASTC), in collaboration with the Yale Project on Climate Change and the Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology, is conducting a three-year project whose goal is to build the capacity of twelve science centers as well as of twelve NSF-funded Long-term Ecological Research Centers (LTER) for the purpose of engaging the public in climate change science. The twelve sites span the USA from the east coast to Hawaii.  The goal of these simultaneous projects is to illustrate local indicators of global change.  Additional partners include ScienCentral, Inc. (TV media producers), the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research, the American Geophysical Union, NOAA, Natural History magazine, and a national board of advisors.  Deliverables include: (1) twelve local demonstration projects with launch programs, exhibits/programs, TV spots, citizen science activities, and an interactive map illustrating the work of the twelve sites, (2) professional development for informal STEM education professionals and LTER research faculty, (3) a national survey to assess the USA population?s climate literacy, and (4) a culminating workshop for the ISE field, a permanent resource database, and a final publication.  Evaluation processes are being conducted by David Heil &amp; Associates.","Coastal ecosystems are experiencing changes in nutrient loading and species composition much higher than previously measured, undoubtedly affecting productivity and sustainability of coastal regions. Predicting the impacts of these changes is important in salt marshes because marshes are among the most biologically productive areas in the world and provide critical ecosystem services, such as nursery areas for fisheries, removal of nitrogen, and shoreline storm buffering.  This project addresses a critical question: What are the effects of increased nutrients and species change on ecosystem services provided by salt marsh ecosystems? The project is the first to use whole-ecosystem experiments that alter nutrient loading and reduce fish populations to understand the effects on nutrient cycling, species diversity, food webs and the long-term sustainability of salt marshes.The damage by Hurricane Katrina due to degradation of coastal wetlands is one example of the importance of salt marshes to society. A growing appreciation of this role for marshes has led to estuaries becoming the focus of large-scale restoration programs. This project will provide information essential for developing water quality standards and  providing perspective for multi-million dollar coastal management decisions, such as construction of sewage treatment facilities, regulation of fishing, or rebuilding of lost marshes.","Experimental cybersecurity research is inherently risky. An experiment may involve releasing live malware code, operating a botnet, or creating highly disruptive network conditions. Realism is required in replicating attacks so that proposed defenses can be thoroughly tested and future attacks anticipated. This proposal, in addressing intellectual merit, seeks to develop a unique model for risky experiment management; enabling researchers to carry out experiments that interact with their larger environment while retaining both control and safety. The model forwarded here is based on a very simple line of reasoning: If the behavior of an experiment is completely unconstrained, the behavior of the host environment must be completely constraining, because it can assume nothing about the experiment; but, if the behavior of the experiment is constrained in some particular and well-chosen way or ways, the behavior of the host testbed can be less constraining, because the combination of experiment and environment constraints together can provide the required overall assurance of good behavior.  The key benefit of this model is that both experimenter and testbed operator can proceed with assurance in carrying out a wide and interesting range of previously unsupportable experiments. The ultimate goal is to develop both implementation and formalization of this model, including logical tools to reason about experiment and testbed constraint composition (broader impact). Initial work will develop mechanisms to support the model in the DETER facility and similar Emulab-based testbeds.The proposal was reviewed by panelists and received one Very Good, one Very Good/Good and one Good.  Panelists viewed all three elements of the proposal (risky experimentation support, dynamic health monitoring, and federation of testbeds) to represent contributions to the field, with the most valuable area of the three being risky experimentation support. The panel overall wanted to see a stronger case made for improving existing security testbeds in general, and particularly a tie in with current uses and needs of the DETER testbed by researchers. Panelists recognized the team as being well qualified for the work. If successful, the activities were viewed as advancing the state-of-the-art in experimental facilities for cybersecurity.","ABSTRACTDRL-0822128PI: John RistveyInstitution: Mid-Continent Research for Education and Learning (McREL)Title: NanoTeach: Professional Development in Nanoscale ScienceThis project is exploring the introduction of nanoscience curriculum into high schools. It is creating and studying a professional development model based on two products, the NanoTeach Teacher's Guide and the NanoTeach Facilitator's Guide. The NanoTeach Teacher's guide is being designed for self study by teachers (low treatment group) and for use in a facilitated development model (high treatment group). The NanoTeach Facilitator's Guide outlines the professional development experiences and provides guidance for facilitators. The professional development model combines (1) a design framework (Designing Effective Science Lessons based on the C-U-E model: content, understanding, and environment); (2) nanoscale science content from NSF-funded curriculum projects; and (3) multiple delivery methods. Twenty teachers are being recruited to carry out the pilot testing of the professional development materials. 75 teachers in the high treatment group are experiencing a 2-week summer workshop, asynchronous sessions while they implement their first lesson, Versatile Classroom (a synchronous, online video technology), implementation of a second lesson, and a final 2-week summer workshop. 75 teachers in the low treatment group experience a brief orientation to nanoscience resources, have access to the NT Teacher's Guide, implement two lessons, and debrief. The NanoTeach partnership includes Aspen Associates, the Stanford Nanofabrication Facility, and the National Nanotechnology Infrastructure Network. The research study is being carried out by Aspen Associates, and project evaluation is conducted by Dr. Doug Huffman of the University of Kansas.","The Entrepreneurial Leadership in STEM Teaching &amp; learning (EnLiST) Partnership is comprised of Thornton High School District #205, South Holland, IL, Champaign Unit 4 School District, Champaign, IL, and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, which serves as the lead among these core partners.  In addition, the following are supporting partners: The Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy (IMSA), IMSA-affiliated school districts, and Thornton elementary and middle school feeder districts.  EnLiST intends to develop and build the infrastructural elements necessary to sustain a state-wide Illinois community of highly qualified science Teacher Leaders, who will effectively contribute to the transformation of science teaching and learning throughout the K-12 educational continuum in their districts. EnLiST will achieve these goals through a combination of intensive summer institutes and year-round professional development and collaborative activities. The synergy and continuity of these efforts will be ensured through establishment of an on-line community capitalizing on robust technological tools and infrastructure. EnLiST will commence with the development of core cadres of high school chemistry and physics Teacher Leaders organized into district teams. Next, the partnership will support and scaffold the activities of these core cadres as they engage in developing a cadre of middle school and elementary specialist science Teacher Leaders in their school districts. The activities of this latter participant group will focus on an interdisciplinary approach to science teaching and learning in elementary and middle school. Data collection and use will be a central theme in the development of Teacher Leaders and project operation as a whole. The innovation of EnLiST is its intent to reconceptualize the very notion of a  Teacher Leader  by drawing on scholarship in the field of social and entrepreneurial leadership and theories of distributed leadership.  EnLiST aims to create a new generation of Teacher Leaders who, armed with cutting edge content knowledge, a strong pedagogical repertoire, and entrepreneurial spirit, can support their colleagues and transform their schools into responsive and data driven institutions of teaching and learning.  EnLiST will provide participant science Teacher Leaders with understandings, skills, attitudes, and habits of mind enabling them to perceive themselves, and to act, as agents of change.  The entrepreneurial leadership skills that will be developed will arm these Teacher Leaders to meet the many challenges faced by teachers in the current US K-12 educational milieu, including dealing with resource constraints, uncertainty, and multiple goals often related to internally desired and externally imposed demands for change and innovation. They will be equipped to meet the challenges and tensions that have often impeded the adoption of innovative curricula and pedagogies and transformation of K-12 science instructional practices in service of addressing increasingly diverse student population needs. The major research questions of the project will center on understanding and assessing the development of the target Teacher Leaders and the success of those leaders in transforming their own teaching.  The ultimate aim is to develop a scalable national model for the preparation of social and entrepreneurial science Teacher Leaders who act as strong champions and effective initiators and implementors of change in pre-college science teaching and learning.  The EnLiST research questions are: (a) What is the impact, if any, of the project's activities on participant Teacher Leaders' conceptions, attitudes, skills, and behaviors related to social and entrepreneurial leadership? (b) What is the nature of the perceived organizational culture in partner school districts in relation to barriers to, and encouragement of, innovation and change? What are the associated roles of Teacher Leaders and school administrators? (c) What is the differential impact, if any, of enhanced social and entrepreneurial leadership among Teacher Leaders on effecting innovation and change in science teaching and learning in partner school districts?","PRISM Phase II is conducting research on strategies that lead to changes in the culture of science and mathematics education where dimensions of culture include policies, practices, partnerships, and resources.  Research studies in PRISM Phase II are producing further evidence of how and to what extent distinctive PRISM Phase I strategies - K-16 Professional Learning Communities, Culture of Higher Education and a Public Awareness Campaign - give rise to these four key elements of holistic cultural change.  The Phase II PRISM partnership is producing these outcomes through an integrated set of research studies focused on the following questions: 1) In what ways and to what extent do K-16 professional learning communities lead to partnerships which change professional practice of K-16 educators and improve student learning in K-16 science and mathematics? 2) To what extent do policy change and incentive structures that reward higher education faculty to collaborate with K-12 schools and to strengthen their own teaching result in sustainable changes in departmental and institutional culture, including changed policies, changed practices, new partnerships and dedicated resources, in higher education? 3) To what extent do schools that participate in the Public Awareness Campaign have greater student motivation, greater parental involvement and higher student achievement in science and mathematics than non-participating schools? PRISM Phase II expects to culminate in replicable models for implementing the three strategies in ways which elicit changes in culture and ultimately strengthen K-16 science and mathematics education.  Based upon the successes of PRISM Phase I, the University System of Georgia (USG) has launched a STEM Initiative, in FY 2009, designed to replicate the successes of PRISM throughout all 35 USG institutions.  Through STEM Initiative funding, 12 institutions will implement K-16 professional learning communities and faculty incentive programs for participation in the scholarship of teaching and learning with faculty from all USG institutions invited to participate in STEM-focused Faculty Institutes on the Teaching and Learning of Science and Mathematics.  The implementation of STEM Initiative-supported learning communities provide a broad base of activity to support experimental studies, as well as avenues by which the results of the Phase II work also immediately inform the work of the STEM Initiative team.  This provides a direct avenue of dissemination of Phase II results to all public institutions of higher education in Georgia.  Phase II research findings are also being disseminated through presentations at national and regional conferences and through scholarly journals and proceedings.","Mathematics (21) This collaborative project addresses a problem that occurs in many mathematics and mathematics-related courses at the university-level across the US: high failure rates in important early college mathematics courses, especially in Calculus I. The teaching strategy being used and tested is based on the idea of using Enhanced Conceptual Development through Focused Oral Discourse, or Orals. The current work is analyzing and extending  earlier work that has been focused on helping students identified as at risk of failing calculus. Based on the earlier success of reducing failure rates using effective teaching strategies, including Orals, the project team is now applying these teaching strategies to diverse users in several new settings: to classes taught in different STEM (science, technology engineering, and mathematics) departments, at a different college, and at different educational levels. The goals of this project are to: 1) Refine, implement, and test Orals with diverse groups of learners and in diverse education settings; 2) Provide training, coaching and evaluation for facilitators of Orals including Instructors, Teaching Assistants and Undergraduate Learning Assistants; 3) Provide extensive assessment artifacts of the implementations; 4) Create a database and website of new learning materials (Orals questions for diverse courses); and 5) Improve the retention and understanding of STEM students. Intellectual Merit: The importance of discourse in the mathematical sciences classroom has already been shown for K-12. A potentially important impact of this proposal will be to contribute to the national dialogue by conducting careful experiments that assess one method of increasing discourse: Orals. In particular, the project team will conduct proof of concept studies of Orals, in moving from small classrooms (the original setting) to large lecture sections. Broader Impact: Many STEM majors require successful completion of a calculus sequence; however, many university students do not achieve their career goals because of their inability to pass the introductory calculus courses. This project will address this important national issue. The new work will not only be in a larger variety of mathematics courses, but also in introductory Aerospace and Mechanical Engineering courses, and at a local high school in a two-year algebra course.","Recently, the 230Th constant-flux proxy (CFP) profiling method of calculating sediment accumulation rates (ARs) has become a topic of significant controversy, especially with respect to the issue of sediment focusing and its quantification.  Depending on whether one derives ARs using age models or CFPs leads to vastly different interpretations in paleoceanographic studies.   Under this award the PIs will investigate sediment redistribution processes to determine the veracity of the 230Th CFP.  They will measure another CFP with an independent source term, namely interplanetary dust particles (IDPs), and the extraterrestrial 3He contained therein.  Agreement between 230Th and 3He variations in varied and well-studied depositional environments in the North Atlantic would constitute further support for the use of both CFPs for flux normalization. The data generated on sites with known amounts of sediment focusing and winnowing will help constrain the influence of abyssal currents on IDPs and the sediments carrying adsorbed 230Th, and will provide insights into the extent of hydrodynamic sorting of these particles. When combined with 14C and paired 3He and 230Th measurement on various separated fractions of the fine-grained component of the sediment, the PIs will test the hypotheses that 1) 3He is less sensitive than 230Th to sediment focusing, and 2) the degree to which sediment redistribution processes fractionate 3He-containing IDPs from the 230Th containing portion of the sediment. In the future, the proponents hope to develop a new proxy (3He/230Th ratio) for changes in the strength of deep-sea currents in association with past climatic changes.   This project will involve students in their teaching, training and learning.","Dr. Andrea Ghez (University of California - Los Angeles), along with collaborators Marshall Perrin (University of California - Los Angeles) and Rachel Kuzio de Naray (University of California - Irvine) will organize and conduct the seventh annual symposium of the National Science Foundation Astronomy and Astrophysics Postdoctoral Fellowship (AAPF) program. The symposium, to be held January 3-4, 2009 in Long Beach, California, will bring together the AAPF fellows, faculty mentors, prospective AAPF applicants, and interested members of the astronomical community. This will allow the fellows to present their research and educational activities, and to better establish ways to enrich the fellowship experience itself. Additionally, fellows will obtain opportunities to establish interdisciplinary projects with colleagues during the symposium. The integration of educational activities into the research efforts of the fellows provides for a broad impact of the fellowship program. Many fellows participate in K-12/public outreach activities, leading to enhancement of the public's interest in science. The symposium will allow the fellows to share their ideas and experiences, not only among themselves, but also with faculty mentors and with others in attendance.","Groundwater flow systems within the Great Basin, Nevada are remarkable in many respects. Despite the arid conditions and relatively low permeability volcanic rocks and basin fill, this region hosts active geothermal systems and world class Eocene age gold deposits. Temperature profiles, fluid inclusion studies, and isotopic evidence suggest that modern and fossil hydrothermal systems share many common features including the absence of a clear magmatic fluid source, discharge areas restricted to fault zones, and remarkably high temperatures ( &gt;200 °C) at shallow depths (200-1500 m). Many of the Great Basin geothermal systems exhibit some of the highest shallow crustal heat flow levels ever recorded ( &gt; 2000 mW/m2 at Beowawe) within the continental crust. Geochemical and isotopic data collected at the Beowawe geothermal system suggests that fluid circulation is deep (&gt; 5 km) and comprised of relatively unexchanged Pleistocene meteoric water with small ä18O (The goal of this proposal is to understand the three-dimensional plumbing, fluid flow impelling mechanisms, and temporal evolution of modern and fossil hydrothermal flow systems within the Great Basin. We wish to evaluate two end member questions regarding the nature of hydrothermal circulation within the Great Basin: A) Is flow restricted to high permeability fault planes driven by free-convection? or B) is flow driven by water-table topographic gradients with some combination of matrix and fault controlled fluid circulation? Because of the lack of broad low heat flow anomalies adjacent to Great Basin geothermal fields, we suspect that these flow systems must be episodic in nature due to permeability reduction associated with silica mineralization. By including the systematics of silica precipitation (and associated porosity/permeability reduction), we hope to constrain the duration of these geothermal systems. We will develop a suite of 3D, single-phase, hydrothermal models using a new parallel finite element code (PGEOFE) for two field sites within the Great Basin. We will develop geologically/geophysically constrained, three-dimensional hydrothermal models of the modern Beowawe and fossil Carlin geothermal systems; two sites with rich , isotopic, geochemical and geothermal data sets. Using LaGrit mesh generation software, these hydrogeologic models will honor known fault geometries, widths, and stratigraphy. A unique feature of the proposed work is that we will use multiple constraints including temperature profiles, shallow heat flow maps, fluid/rock ä 18O composition, and the age of hot springs deposits to test our models. We will also develop more sophisticated reactive-transport geochemical models using PFLOTRAN incorporating porosity-enhancing carbonate dissolution reactions to constrain how long the Carlin flow systems remained active before becoming clogged by gangue mineralization. By dating organic matter (pollen) within the hot springs deposits at Beowawe using 14C dating methods, we hope to determine whether or not these hot springs deposits formed during a single event or in several episodes.Our study may help document the existence of time-dependent natural convection systems within the Great Basin. Understanding the mechanisms and patterns of fluid circulation within this region is of great societal relevance because this region may soon host our nation?s high level nuclear wastes. The project will support two graduate students at New Mexico Tech and University of Missouri at Columbia.","TECHNICAL ABSTRACTData-intensive science requires tera- and peta-scale computing. Hardware demands are high, and software, from system to application level, is highly specialized. As a result, scientific investigation is constrained. New and more accessible models for large-scale computing are required. The proposed program seeks to leverage new off-the-shelf computing technologies to develop concepts and tools (e.g., programming strategies, general-purpose and domain-specific libraries) to enable practical and transparent Scalable Heterogeneous Computing (SHC). Results will be applied to three cutting-edge challenges in radio astronomy, quantum chemistry, and neuroscience. These three applications share the need to process massive data streams. They broadly span a parameter space of processing challenges, defined by complexity in computation, data volume, and throughput. Addressing these requires scalable algorithms for massive datasets, systems with high-bandwidth memory access, and the ability to process high-throughput data streams.    Proposed SHC strategies, tools, and optimizations would develop, for general scientific computing, use of massively parallel graphics processing units (GPUs) and fast, low-power, large-volume, solid-state storage (SSS) devices that are commercially available. The tools developed will be applied to the analysis of radioastronomy data generated by the Muchison Wide-Field Array, the development of a SHC-enabled molecular quantum chemistry code, and to the Connectome project, an effort to make a complete map of the neuron connectivity of mammalian brains. Education is tightly integrated into the SHC program at the undergraduate and graduate levels. Initiatives to disseminate results will include tutorials and documented open-source libraries as well as workshops.LAY ABSTRACTScientists engaged in data-intensive research, from astronomy to neuroscience, are in desperate need of new strategies and tools. This project approaches the challenge by leveraging new off-the-shelf hardware and software technologies in unique combinations. The project will bring massively parallel graphics processing units and fast solid-state storage devices together with traditional central processing units. Project staff will develop scalable algorithms that leverage this commercially available hardware to process massive data sets and streams of data. The project will use three major scientific challenges as testbeds for development of these new approaches: a radioastronomy telescope called the Murchison Wide-Field Array; exploration of chemistry at the quantum level; and the Connectome, an effort to make a complete map of the neuron connectivity in mammalian brains. Postdoctoral researchers from astronomy, chemistry, neuroscience, and computer science will work together at Harvard?s Initiative in Innovative Computing, where they will combine experience from these domains to develop algorithms and code to broadly enable advances in science. The project will include tutorials, workshops and documented code libraries and a strong educational component.","Collaborative Research: Time-Dependent Hydrothermal Convection within the Great Basin, NevadaIs groundwater flow restricted  to  high permeability  fault planes driven by free-convection?  Or, is flow driven by water-table topographic gradients  with some combination of matrix and fault controlled fluid circulation? Are these systems fundamentally transient and self-sealing due to gaunge mineralization, or , is permeability enhanced by  carbonate dissolution? To evaluate these problems we will develop a suite of 3D, single-phase, hydrothermal models using a new parallel finite element code (PGEOFE) for two field sites within the Great Basin.  We will utilize a new three-dimensional (3-D) geologic model of  the  modern Beowawe geothermal system and, with USGS colleagues, develop another 3-D geologic model of the Eocene  Carlin system; two sites with rich , isotopic, geochemical and geothermal data sets. Using LaGrit mesh generation software, these hydrogeologic models will honor known fault geometries, widths, and  stratigraphy. This mesh generation software will allow us to honor low grid aspect ratios (required by the AZTEC parallel solver package)  as the grid transitions from strata to faults while allowing sufficient refinement to minimize numerical grid dispersion when solving the heat and mass transport equations.  We will use multiple constraints including temperature profiles, shallow heat flow maps, fluid/rock ä 18O composition, and the age of hot springs deposits to constrain our models. At Beowawe, by dating pollen in the sinter terrace and adualria in exposed veins nearby we can get a sense of the timing of episodic discharges of hot fluid up the faults and on the duration of such discharges recorded by the sinter deposits. More sophisticated reactive-transport geochemical models will be developed using PFLOTRAN  to evaluate porosity-enhancing carbonate dissolution reactions and ?sealing gangue precipitation reactions in each system. Our models will be validated by comparing modern and fossil geochemical and thermal proxies . The project will support two graduate students at New Mexico Tech and University of Missouri at Columbia. Initial results will be presented to industry representatives from Beowawe power plant, Barrick and Newmont gold mines for their input and feedback to improve the final result. Results will be published at the Geological Society of Nevada 2010 symposium and scientific journals to reach local and international audiences.","THERMOREGULATORY CAPACITY LIND EXERCISE RESPONSES FOLLOWING PROLONGED LUNAR ANALOG BED REST -Impaired exercise-thermoregulation and altered cardiovascular responses to exercise (i.e. - reduced work capacity / elevated heart rate for a given exercise workl","ABSTRACT: Studying the contributions of U.S. universities to the innovation process and National Income is important to understanding how our current economic status has been achieved and to how our international competitiveness may be maintained or increased. This project models a key component of the innovation system, particularly creation and deployment of knowledge and the flows of financial resources. The objectives of this work are to produce estimates of the contributions of various combinations of university resources, especially those of STEM units, to outcomes that represent intermediate steps in the innovation process and that contribute to NI and thus to U.S. competitiveness.The key insight of the project is that universities produce multiple outputs--for example supplies of highly skilled labor and new knowledge. The importance of this labor and technological development to the national economy has been well established in both classical and evolutionary economic theory.  In addition, universities serve as support institutions for firms and industries. Universities contribute to intermediate outcomes that stimulate innovation processes and fuel the national economy. The primary emphasis is to use data to develop new models explaining the relationships among resource deployment in U. S. universities and intermediate (to National Income growth) university outcomes, particularly in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM).  These are outcomes that are important to U.S. economic growth and ultimately to international competitiveness and hence the models can be used to inform science and technology investment decisions.The project builds a relational meta data base that examines the relationships among resource deployment in U.S. universities and intermediate university outcomes related to innovation and economic growth. The data for the project are derived from a variety of sources at the institutional, departmental, and individual levels. Intermediate and final outcomes include wages paid, the production of graduates, patents, licenses, start-up and spin-off companies, consultancies, joint industry-university grants and contracts, job-training programs for firms? employees, and importantly, research papers. ?Inputs? related to these outcomes include various university resources: e.g., the human resources of university faculty, staff, and student workers; the time allocations of these individuals across teaching, research and service; and the allocation of the university?s own financial resources. BROADER IMPACTS: The benefits include advancing understanding of the relationships among resource deployment in U. S. universities and intermediate university outcomes in STEM fields. These are outcomes that are important to U.S. economic growth and ultimately to international competitiveness. Thus, the models can be used to inform science and technology investment decisions.","Sulfur is an essential element in proteins, lipids, and some critical metabolites. The work proposed in this grant continues an exploration of the regulatory aspects of sulfur deprivation responses in the alga Chlamydomonas. Regulatory mutants aberrant for sulfur-deprivation responses and suppressor strains will be characterized to help identify interactions among signaling factors. Wild-type and various mutant strains will be queried with genome-wide methods for examining the transcriptome under nutrient-replete and sulfur-starvation conditions, using both microarray and Solexa sequencing technologies. Focused intellectual and technical efforts will be directed toward establishing more biochemical links between identified regulators. A diversity of protein-protein interaction assays, including the yeast two-hybrid system, the split ubiquitin and split GFP systems and the classical co-immunoprecipitation assays will facilitate these studies, providing strong insights into the regulatory circuits that control nutrient limitation responses in photosynthetic organisms. Finally, analyses will be performed to help understand the two tiers of the sulfur-deprivation response that have recently been discovered; one is protein synthesis-independent while the other is protein synthesis-dependent. In a broader sense, the proposed work will help untangle some of the complexities associated with the regulatory machinery that is required for photosynthetic cells to cope with deprivation conditions and ultimately help us understand the impact of sulfur compounds in our diets and on global weather patterns; some sulfur compounds strongly influence the quality and nutritional value of food while others have profound effects on the climate of the Earth. The project will train a post doctoral student and will involve collaboration with Dr. Charles Hauser and his undergraduate students at St. Edward's University, who will participate in summer exchange and in the analysis of microarray results. St. Edward's University is a minority serving institution.","Understanding the sensitivity of food systems to global change is limited by high uncertainties associated with the cross-scale interactions between the natural environment and the cultural landscape. Defining what might be within a suite of plausible futures requires a baseline scenario that captures the factors that are most significant in shaping decisions at different levels of governance, and which highlights the current, changing and interacting sensitivities of the system to stressors associated with both climate change and economic and cultural globalization. This project will create such a baseline by assessing the drivers and evolving social outcomes of one of the world's most important food systems: the Mexican maize system. Building on prior research that anticipates climate change will have negative impacts for Mexican maize production, and the globalization of agricultural markets is further challenging the future of maize in Mexico, an interdisciplinary team of social and biophysical scientists will investigate Mexican agricultural vulnerability in terms of a complex food system, in which individual decisions to plant or not to plant maize are hypothesized to manifest as landscape scale transformations. The research team also expects that global to regional price signals and climatic variability will affect local food production and land use outcomes differently across the Mexican landscape, as a function of regionally-specific cultural, economic, demographic, ecological and political factors. The project involves: a) a description of the changing national geography of maize production and the associated socioeconomic, institutional, and demographic correlates; b) an analysis of climate trends and variability as related to maize production, yields and water availability for irrigated farming; c) an econometric analysis of the spatial patterns of maize price volatility in three maize-producing states in order to evaluate the contribution of maize price volatility to farm-level risk and d) an evaluation of the drivers (e.g., prices and climate) and outcomes (land use, perceptions of food quality, and household maize expenditures) of maize abandonment / persistence at the farm-level through case studies in the states of Sinaloa, Mexico and Chiapas. A combination of approaches will be used, including exploratory spatial data analysis (ESDA), econometrics analysis (spatial, time-series, and spatial panels), agro-climatic analyses, and household livelihood surveys.This interdisciplinary and multi-method project involves experts in economic geography, econometrics, spatial analysis, livelihood assessment, climatology, agroecology and public policy in Mexico and the United States. It will provide the foundation for subsequent research on the development of scenarios of future social-ecological change and vulnerability of food security in Mexico. The project consolidates a strong international collaborative research community, involving Arizona State University, University of California Santa Barbara, the Colegio de Mexico (Mexico City), the Colegio de la Frontera Sur (Chiapas), and the National Institute of Forestry, Agriculture and Livestock Research (INIFAP, Mexico City). The project aims to enhance this network throughout the project's implementation, by inviting Mexican experts external to the project to participate in part of the annual project coordination meetings to share their research and insights. Graduate students from the U.S. institutions will collaborate with research counterparts in Mexico. The approaches and findings from the project will be used as case material for graduate and undergraduate courses in earth system science, regional analysis, development economics and sustainable food systems. The diagnostic and analytical results of this project will be disseminated through a variety of forums to maize policy experts of the national agricultural secretary (SAGARPA), state agriculture ministries in Sinaloa, State of Mexico and Chiapas, non-governmental organizations interested in land use change and maize diversity, and to the academic communities in Mexico and the U.S. The project's results will also be disseminated to Mexican authorities responsible for climate change initiatives nationally in order to contribute to the efforts of these agencies to comply with international climate change agendas.","ADVANCES IN PHOTOMETRIC PRECISION FOR ALL-SKY EXOPLANET SURVEYS SUMMARY: MIT / Harvard-Smithsonian / Google / and NASA ARC are partners in a new initiative to discover more than 1000 new transiting exoplanets including several exoplanets comparable in siz","This project focuses on the study of DNA-protein complexes through single-DNA micromanipulation. Using magnetic tweezers and micropipette manipulation of DNAs attached to micron-sized particles, the dynamics of formation, mechanical properties, and catalytic function of nucleoprotein complexes will be measured. Self-assembly, activities and disassembly of these protein-DNA complexes will be studied via precise time-resolved measurement of mechanical properties, i.e. molecular lengths as a function of applied force. This simple yet versatile approach allows observation of kinetics of reactions as well as equilibrium states, for proteins that reorganize DNA structure. The project will also include development of transverse magnetic tweezer methods, including techniques for experiments on two DNA segments at once. Broader impacts of this research will be via its highly interdisciplinary nature, and by development of new biophysical techniques (transverse magnetic tweezer and combined magnetic tweezer/micropipette methods) for study of DNA-protein interactions. Along with this, the proposed activities will focus on research education for Ph.D. and postdoctoral students, combining physics and biology. Funding for this award is provided by the Division of Physics and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate and by the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences in the Biosciences Directorate.","Intelligent Merit: This study will examine and clarify for policymakers and researchers the impact of statewide policy changes that increased the availability of advanced STEM courses for a greater number of schools and students.  The proposer will analyze the extent to which the policy changes affect outcomes for all students, particularly students who are underrepresented in STEM areas.  This study, then, will provide critical information about the effectiveness of policy changes for stakeholders who have a vested interest in understanding the effects of advanced curricular programs on student enrollment in STEM courses during high school and early college.  The project will address two key research questions: 1. Who enrolls in accelerated academic programs?  What are the factors (the student and school) that influence enrollment in different accelerated and non-accelerated curricular programs? 2. Do accelerated academic programs increase students? STEM coursetaking in high school and during their first year of postsecondary school (Grade 13)?  Do some programs increase STEM coursetaking more than others?  Do these programs reduce gaps in STEM coursetaking among historically underrepresented students and their peers?The proposer will use a mixed method approach to address the research questions that includes a quantitative analysis of extant longitudinal data in the state of Florida and a qualitative assessment of non-statistical factors through site visits to schools.  Ten years of quantitative data from the Florida Department of Education (FLDOE) will serve as the main source of information the proposer will use to study the characteristics of both students and schools.  The FLDOE dataset includes a rich array of high school and postsecondary data (e.g. transcripts; dual enrollment and achievement data in these courses; regular 1-12 grades school test scores; demographic data; poverty index information).  Two sets of school site visits will be conducted in the state?s major urban centers as well as small suburban high schools to provide insights not captured through quantitative analysis.  During the initial visits, data will be collected via course catalogs and interviews with school personnel.  For follow-up visits, data will be collected through student focus groups about all aspects of course offerings and course taking.  Broader Impacts: Contribution to the field of knowledge about student enrollment in advanced STEM coursework will likely advance discovery in this area.  The extensiveness of the work (examination of student and school factors from high school to college in mathematics and science) increases the importance of results to local and national policymakers and researchers. The wide range of expertise (individuals and institutions) adds significantly to the strength of the proposal and increases the credibility of expected outcomes.  Lessons-learned from prior work will serve as the foundation for the development of some of the study?s data collection instruments. The dissemination plan is strong and the Urban Institute appears well positioned to carry out this component of the scope of work.","Computer security is a field in which defenses are pitted against adversaries.  Thus, it is critical to understand the capabilities and motivations of the adversary if one is to plan effective defenses.  However, modern Internet-based attacks are largely driven by economic factors that are only understood in the abstract.  While we know that it is sufficiently cheap to compromise Internet hosts that large-scale botnets have become a compelling platform for launching attacks, we simply do not understand the scale of the revenue that that such activities bring in.  While we understand that billions of spam e-mails are sent per day, the conversion rate of this spam ? the probability that a sent message will result in a ?sale? ? is largely unknown.  Absent such information it is difficult to reason about the structural nature of the conflict between attackers and defenders.Traditionally, obtaining information about the critical economic factors in Internet attacks is difficult because such information is only visible to the attacker themselves.  Our research is focused on sidestepping this issue by infiltrating the technical infrastructure ? the botnets themselves ? used by Internet miscreants.  Our technique, called ?distribution infiltration? provides a means to directly quantify key aspects of spam and phishing campaigns as well as to measure the impact of defenses on an economic footing (i.e., their impact on the profitability of e-crime).  Our research will both refine these methodologies and produce concrete data for developing economic-based threat models of computer security.","THE EURASIAN FRESHWATER CYCLE FROM GRACE AND IN-S ITU HYDROLOGIC NETWORKS: DISTINGUISHING WATER CYCLE BEHAVIOR IN PERMAFROST AND NON-PERMAFROST REGIONS- We propose to use monthly values of time-variable gravity from GRACE in combination with runoff / prec","ISPI CASSINI - INSTANTANEOUS STELLAR PARALLAX INVESTIGATION VIA CASSINI- We propose a novel technique / ISPI (INSTANTANEOUS STELLAR PARALLAX INVESTIGATION) / to measure distances to astrophysical sources using a combination of Cassini in the Saturn system","Layer-8 attacks (e.g., spam and phishing) are launched from a malicious service platform, e.g., botnet, which consists of a large number of infected machines (or bots). Such an attack platform relies on lower-layer network services to achieve efficiency, robustness, and stealth in communication and attack activities. These services include look-up (e.g., DNS), hosting (e.g., Web servers), and transport (e.g., BGP).The main research goals and approaches of the CLEANSE project are:         1. Control-plane monitoring. Much of the infrastructure for mounting layer-8 attacks involves abuse of the control plane in core network services (e.g., DNS and BGP).The CLEANSE project develops control-plane anomaly detection sensors that are distributed, online, and real-time.         2. Data-plane monitoring. The project develops new and general network anomaly detection algorithms based on traffic sampling and clustering for monitoring high-speed traffic.         3. Improved security auditing capabilities. The CLEANSE project develops packet  tagging/tainting  techniques to enable tracking and clustering of network traffic flows (e.g., that are generated by the same bot program). The project also develops improved traffic sampling capabilities that are attack-aware and distributed network-wide.By focusing on monitoring of core network services, the CLEANSE framework can detect future layer-8 attacks and new forms of large-scale malware infections. The project also creates educational contents, including new textbooks and on-line course materials, which directly benefit from the research activities. The CLEANSE project team also work with industry partners (including the ISPs) to organize focused workshops that bring together researchers from academia and practitioners from the industry/ISP, government, and law enforcement agencies to foster the exchange of ideas, data, and technologies.","Preliminary analysis of the storms preceding the recent Eastern Iowa floods have revealed that there was no single, extreme storm that was responsible for the flood conditions. Instead, the effect of a sequence of storms compounded, affecting locations along the larger rivers in the basin. We propose to investigate: (1) the link between the characteristics of the storms (or group of storms) that caused the floods along the Iowa River; (2) how storm properties are related to flooding as a function of basin scale, following insights from a new geophysical theory of floods; and (3) whether the methodologies developed here can be extended to other large basins using the Hydro?]NEXRAD radar?]rainfall dataset.The urgency of our proposal lies in the pressing need to understand the causes and far?]reaching effects of the 2008 Iowa flood. Undoubtedly, local authorities and communities will be looking to our research facility, IIHR?]Hydroscience and Engineering at The University of Iowa, to analyze the flooding events and offer guidance in adopting measures to prevent or mitigate the effect of future floods. While this proposal addresses a very recent, ongoing natural disaster, it is grounded in our collective, sustained work on the geophysical theory of floods.Intellectual Merit: Over the past 20 years, scientists at the University of Colorado, The University of Iowa, and other institutions have collaborated on a new theory of floods. Recent advances in this theory have revealed the important role played by the self?]similar structure of the river network in determining the magnitude of peak flows. In particular, flow aggregation patterns imposed by the presence of the river network provide explicit guidelines to understand the genesis of extreme flooding events similar to the ones in Eastern Iowa in June 2008. This framework allows rapid and physically meaningful analysis of flood events across a range of spatial scales, without the need to resort to rainfall?]runoff model calibration.Broader Impacts: This work could potentially change the concept of Probable Maximum Precipitation and Probable Maximum Flood and their use in engineering design. The analysis will also offer significant insight into our globally changing climate.","This project seeks to understand how science, public opinion, and media interact in shaping public decision making. The context of inquiry for this project will be the six communities currently being evaluated by the Department of Homeland Security to host the National Bio- and Agro-defense Facility (NBAF). The design incorporates public opinion survey methodology, in-depth interviews with stakeholders and media content analysis. This multi-faceted design will provide insights into both successful and failed communication strategies aimed at engaging local residents, and help the research team develop a better understanding of how public deliberation can help or undermine efforts to meaningfully connect with various publics on risk-related issues. The research will contribute to understanding the social amplification an attenuation of risk. In particular, the PI is interested in two levels of outcome variables. At a first level, the PI will explore how the interplay of media coverage, interpersonal channels, and predispositional factors shape feelings of trust toward various stakeholders, including executive and regulatory bodies at the state and federal level, local agencies and governments, and other regional players. This first outcome variable is likely to directly shape a second-level outcome variable that this project examines through comparative analysis of multiple communities: public perceptions of risks and their dynamic nature over time.","We propose applying transcendence techniques to curves and abelian varieties in a family and to classical period maps to deduce transcendence properties for functions which are solutions of a Picard-Fuchs equation. This leads naturally to considering the distribution of points with special properties on subvarieties of Shimura varieties. These special properties can be interpreted as meaning that the points lie on the intersection of the subvariety with certain Shimura subvarieties. This leads to studying open conjectures in the theory of Shimura varieties. We also propose an approach independent of these conjectures which would involve studying the locus of ``irreducible'' points on subvarieties of Shimura varieties. We propose developing a transcendence theory for more general varieties in a family, and for more general period maps as well as for periods of higher order forms. A fundamental problem in transcendence theory is the determination of the exceptional set of a function, that is the set of algebraic numbers at which the function assumes algebraic values. A classical result is that the exceptional set of the exponential function consists only of the origin. This implies that e and pi are transcendental. In previous work, we determine the exceptional set of the classical hypergemetric function and its generalization to several complex variables by relating these functions to families of algebraic curves. We intend to extend this work to a wider class of functions related to more general families of algebraic curves and varieties.","This Workshop will be held in Hilton Head, South Carolina - March 2009.  Workshop:  A Workshop on Friction:  A Grand Challenge at the interface of Solid and Fluid Mechanics.  A grand challenge lies in the formulation of unified analysis techniques addressing friction through the momentum/energy transfer and thermal processes leading to the diversion of useful kinetic energy to parasitic processes on atomic to continuum scales, irrespective of the media on either side of the interface.Improved understanding and modeling of the multiple origins of friction form a vital component of technologies aimed at reducing the environmental impact of human development and transportation, ranging from reduced wear, noise and/or vibration, increased transmission efficiency, turbulent skin friction reduction for increased vehicle efficiency, improved models and control of pollutant dispersion by atmospheric winds in urban ?rough? environments to advanced understanding of environmental physics and climate phenomena such as ice-field development and glacier melting.","The Professional Development Program (PDP) is designed to prepare science and engineering graduate students for designing and teaching inquiry-based laboratory modules. Led by Dr. Lisa Hunter (University of Hawaii), the PDP includes workshops followed by a practical teaching experience, usually at the college level. In addition to training for teaching, a major outcome of the program is the innovative, inquiry-based laboratory units developed and taught by PDP participants. Laboratory units developed through the PDP have been very successful in Hawaii college courses and programs, and are an essential element of the recently launched Akamai Workforce Initiative (AWI), which includes curriculum development for a new electro-optics program at Maui Community College. This award will support, in part, the workshops held within the PDP and will ensure the inclusion of  Hawaii-based graduate student participants in the program, maintaining the momentum and educational partnerships established by the NSF Center for Adaptive Optics, and now being transferred to AWI, managed by the University of Hawaii, Institute for Astronomy. The PDP is specifically designed to train the next generation of scientists and engineers to teach in a way that engages students from all backgrounds in the processes and practices of science. The integration of research and education is an essential part of the PDP. Included within PDP are sessions on addressing diversity and equity in the classroom.  All PDP participants are required to consider how they will engage all students in their teaching. In addition to the overall focus on diversity and methods for broadening participation, this work will have a significant impact on the Maui community. PDP participants will teach in courses and programs that include significant numbers of Native Hawaiians, Pacific Islanders, and other underrepresented groups.","Scheduling policies are explicitly (or implicitly) used everywhere that resources need to be allocated, and resultantly the theory of scheduling has a long and varied history.  Out of this large body of work, two distinct research communities have emerged and, unfortunately, researchers in each community are often not aware of results from the other community.  One set of researchers from the theoretical computer science and optimization communities has focused on providing competitive guarantees for scheduling disciplines in the worst-case environment.  A different set of researchers, from the performance modeling and applied probability communities, has focused on providing exact performance analyses of scheduling policies in stochastic/probabilistic environments.  Each of these approaches have specific advantages and disadvantages when carried out on their own.  The aim of this project is to develop techniques that can achieve the  best of both worlds , i.e., to combine ideas from each community to arrive at results neither has been able to achieve alone.  Specifically, the goal of this project is to develop approaches that combine worst-case results and techniques with qualitative and quantitative techniques for analyzing stochastic models, thus combining the breadth of models where worst-case results can be applied with the real-world applicability of stochastic analysis. This is an ambitious goal, but one that will open up a new avenue of research in an important, well established field.  If successful, it can bring together ideas from two distinct communities which attack similar problems with very different techniques, and thus is likely to identify new scheduling disciplines that will impact system design in practice.  Additionally, the project will have a broad impact on the education of both undergraduate and graduate students through the development of a new unified approach to teaching scheduling theory.","A Doppler High Frequency (HF) radar is placed at the Jicamarca Peru Incoherent Scatter Radar Facility for the purpose of untangling the processes that lead to the onset of equatorial plasma bubbles (EPBs), and in turn to scintillations of radio signals traversing the ionosphere, including GPS signals.  The spectra and propagation of ionospheric perturbations just below the F-region peak are characterized, and their relationship to EPBs observed at Jicamarca is determined.  The variability of vertical ion drift in the enhanced ion density preceding the neutral wind reversal is determined during solar minimum conditions, and the relationship of that variability to equatorial plasma bubble onset is determined.  The extent to which neutral winds modulate the occurrence of EPBs, and possibly override otherwise effective triggering mechanisms is also evaluated using data from nearby Fabry-Perot interferometers.  The determined relationships between plasma perturbations below the F-region ionospheric peak, variability of the vertical ion drift, the neutral wind, and EPB onset are finally used to in an attempt to predict EPB generation, along with associated radio scintillations.","This research develops measures of firms? resources devoted to the development of new products and business models in the financial services industry, an activity called ?finance R&amp;D.?  The work helps fill a vast gap in our knowledge of the investment and innovation process for a large and important sector of economic activity in the United States. Traditional R&amp;D spending captures the cost of the ?work done? by scientists and engineers because the innovation process in manufacturing is well understood to originate in a laboratory.  But where do financial innovations, such as credit default swaps, derivatives, electronic payment systems, ATMs, and the like originate?  A recent review of the empirical literature on financial innovation (Frame and White 2004) suggests little is known about the process.The novel aspect of our research will be to further develop available measures of intangible investment and capital by exploiting Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) employer-based datasets on employment and wages by detailed occupation and industry. The BLS data will be used in combination with information obtained from semi structured interviews with industry executives to build estimates of the ?work done? by the employees (or contractors) who conduct the design and development activity in (or for) financial services firms.  The interviews will leverage the Conference Board?s extensive network of business contacts to obtain the required information as well as to generally expand our knowledge of the innovation process in financial services industries. The resulting industry-level series for finance R&amp;D will both supplement traditional R&amp;D measures and enhance the Corrado, Hulten, and Sichel (2006) macroeconomic estimates of the contribution of intangible capital to U.S. economic growth.Broader impacts:  The need for better metrics of innovation and the knowledge economy was underscored by the Advisory Committee on Innovation established by the Secretary of Commerce. One of its main findings was to better measure business intangible investments, and another was to develop a fuller accounting of the sources of economic growth. Our research aims to advance these two goals by working on a large and from the standpoint of the empirical productivity literature largely under researched sector of the U.S. economy.","The NSDL Technical Network Services (TNS) project is providing a robust and extensible cyberinfrastructure foundation for the central services of the NSDL that enable a wide range of NSF grantees and outside partners to share technical capacity and deliver valuable educational tools and resources to their own communities. The project has four primary areas of effort:1) Engaging the NSDL and STEM education communities to nurture a common vision for NSDL and its technical infrastructure and to foster broad-based community contributions;2) Enabling NSDL to function as a shared, collaborative, contributory space supporting the creation and display of context around networked educational resources to enhance discovery, use, and understanding; 3) Supporting and extending the NSDL core infrastructure for implementing and developing new educational applications and networked tools for audiences across the full range of STEM research, learning, and education; and4) Ensuring that the NSDL network and its accompanying tools and services are a robust, reliable, and highly available resource for all users.The intellectual merit of this effort lies in the unique and potentially transformative opportunity it has to integrate a wide range of tools, services, content, and context from many different institutions and projects into a common framework of knowledge organization and discovery, enabling other projects to accomplish far more than they could have on their own. By integrating resources, description, context and contribution from many varied organizations, projects, and individuals, and by offering tools to explore and understand this knowledge space, the TNS project is serving as an important component of support for cyber-enabled STEM education in a networked world. The broader impacts of this project are felt along several directions. First, it is helping both NSF grantees and many other related educational projects to better serve their specific audiences by focusing less on recreating technical developments and focusing more on serving as sites for teaching, mentoring, and supporting research of large numbers of STEM students and teachers. Second, it is establishing a broad-based community engagement process to foster creativity, innovation, and contributions to the design and use of next-generation educational cyberinfrastructure and interactive learning applications. Third, it is instrumenting the NSDL infrastructure to collect detailed (anonymized) usage and behavioral data, providing the basis for next-generation research into: personalized learning, educationally-informed recommendation engines, formation and evolution of educational social networks, and other areas where large volumes of user-generated actions and activities are needed.","The NSDL Center for Sustaining Broader Impacts combines intra-community support structures for NSDL grantees with well-defined mechanisms for effective outreach and dissemination in a Web 2.0 world to organizations and coalitions that provide K-12 teachers and/or higher education faculty with educational materials or professional development. Four primary goals guide the work of the center:1) Mobilization: to facilitate the flow of information and communications across NSDL projects to build community capacity, set priorities, and identify emerging issues so that the community can exploit its opportunities and address its challenges collectively.2) Synthesis: to mine the collective knowledge and experience of the community and synthesize the work of NSDL projects to inform community best practices.3) Dissemination: to place resources and research into the hands of educators through targeted outreach activities, by bundling specific products and services to meet users' needs, and by distributing NSDL products and services through trusted dissemination channels.4) Analysis and Evaluation: to create and foster a culture of data gathering and interpretation to support the analysis of needs and trends so that NSDL can create more effective products and services that meet the demands of STEM learners. The intellectual merit of this project lies in its core strategies of: i) brokering partnerships and opportunities on behalf of the community; ii) monitoring trends and practices; iii) promoting and advocating for NSDL; iv) customizing and contextualizing NSDL resources; v) putting NSDL in the path of users; and vi) systematic data gathering to inform short-term decision-making and long-term sustainability planning. Taken together these can serve as a model for Web 2.0 educational organizations. The project is exerting broader impacts through its dedication to the integration of research with education, the provision of services and support for teacher training, professional development, and STEM workforce growth.  By advocating for STEM education through partnership and capacity-building activities, across multiple disciplines and audiences, the center is extending NSDL's reach and effectiveness and creating new channels for reaching audiences and for understanding impact. This effort is essential to the realization of the NSDL community vision of transforming many distinct and important initiatives into an increasingly coherent whole, all in the service of STEM education.","The advent of computer and digital information technologies and there development have greatly changed the world we live in. Today digital technologies are everywhere in our lives. A key step that makes all those technologies possible is to convert analog data into digital ones, a process known analog-to-digital conversion, or A/D conversion. With demand for higher precision and more cutting-edge technologies, the mathematics of A/D conversion algorithms plays a key role in this quest. The research proposed in this proposal focuses mainly on the mathematics and algorithms of A/D conversion. Given that analog devices are to different degrees imprecise by nature, robustness is extremely important if high precision is desired. The proposal will focus on robust A/D conversion algorithms. In this proposal the PI will address two of the main sources of imprecisions: imprecise quantizations and imprecise multiplications. The proposed encoders are the first encoders to be completely robust against quantizer and multiplier imprecisions. The PI proposes to study both the algorithms and the mathematical questions that arise from the study. The PI also studies ways the encoders can be extended and refined, along with many related and often challenging mathematical problems. The core of this project is a novel class of analog-to-digital conversion algorithms. These algorithms have the advantage that they are robust against quantization errors (imprecisions) and multiplication imprecisions. The novelty of these A/D algorithms comes from the use of Golden Ratio based expansions of real numbers related to the Fibonacci numbers. More general algorithms involve a class of algebraic integers and matrix encoders. The PI and his collaborators have already built a circuit of an A/D converter based on one of our algorithms, which has yielded outstanding result. A main objective of this proposal is to study these algorithms in greater depth, particularly concerning the stability and robustness of these algorithms. Equally important is that the study of these A/D algorithms has raised a number of interesting and challenging mathematical questions. Graduate students will be involved in the project. In addition, the proposed research lends naturally to collaborations between mathematicians and the engineering community.","The goal of this project is to test the hypothesis that garnet-bearing amphibolites and pelitic schists from the northwest U.S. Cordillera preserve a record of late Mesoproterozoic high pressure metamorphism that can be attributed to significant crustal thickening along the western margin of Laurentia before or during the assembly of the supercontinent Rodinia. To this end a research team from Washington State University, West Virginia University, and University of Idaho are undertaking an integrated geochronologic and metamorphic analysis of garnet-bearing metamorphic assemblages in the northwest U.S. Cordillera in order to: 1) determine the ages of metamorphism using Lu-Hf and Sm-Nd geochronology of garnets and U-Th-Pb geochronology of monazites in order to determine the extent of Proterozoic metamorphism throughout the northwest U.S. Cordillera; 2) establish the pressure-temperature conditions of mineral growth in these metamorphic assemblages; 3) compare the results from the garnet and monazite chronometers and integrate this information with the metamorphic fabrics using detailed petrography; and 4) link both the geochronologic and pressure-temperature information to the penetrative deformational fabrics preserved in the rocks. Establishment of a linkage between late Mesoproterozoic metamorphism and the high temperature, high-pressure assemblages that exist in these rocks over a considerable area will show that a major period of crustal thickening during convergent tectonism occurred on the western margin of Laurentia at the end of the Mesoproterozoic. The presence of an approximately one billion year old contractional belt in the northwestern U.S., if confirmed, would imply that the history of metamorphism and deformation in the Cordillera is more complicated than previously appreciated. These results would provide important piercing points for late Mesoproterozoic tectonic reconstructions. In particular, results of this project will provide additional constraints on correlations of western Laurentia with other cratonal fragments such as Australia, Siberia, Antarctica, and China and will ultimately impact various reconstructions of Rodinia.The Grenville orogeny was an important event that substantially modified the North American continent approximately one billion years ago. The metamorphic rocks produced in this event can be found in wide belt that extends from eastern Canada to southwestern U.S. and northern Mexico. Preliminary geochronological data yielded the unexpected result that metamorphism of this age also occurred in the northwestern U.S. To confirm these data, this project is using new geochronological methods to determine the ages of minerals that are commonly produced during the metamorphism that occurs during mountain belt formation. If the preliminary results are born out, current understanding of the nature of the Grenville event will require revision. Evidence for a billion year old metamorphic event in the northwest U.S. would also require modification of current ideas about the configuration of continents at that time.","This conference intends to bring a small group of Minority Serving Institution (MSI) faculty and experts in program evaluation to share lessons learned; to present new and evolving theories embedded within indigenous cultural experiences; and, to actively engage in strategizing avenues for improving capacity building and sustaining the application of responsive culturally appropriate evaluations. It is also a needs assessment focused on participant identification of needed capacity building activities in evaluation from three perspectives: their own, their institution and across Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). This grant would be a follow-up to expand previous activities initiated by NSF through the Broadening Participation Initiative in Evaluation Capacity Building.  The proposed conference also would set the stage for designing and revising strategies/models and the review of their use for broadening participation of underrepresented minorities in STEM evaluation.","TECHNICAL SUMMARY:This award supports theoretical research and education on novel quantum phases in orbital and large spin systems with cold atoms. The research explores novel quantum phases and emergent symmetries with cold atoms which are not accessible in usual solid state systems and provides guidance for new experiments. The application of symmetry principles is essential for this project which not only deepens our understanding but also provides the guidance to new discoveries.  A variety of methods in condensed matter physics and field theory are employed, including bosonization, the renormalization group, the large-N method, the self-consistent mean-field theory, and band structure calculations.The first research topic is the study of novel quantum phases in high orbital bands in optical lattices. The p-orbital bosons exhibit complex-valued many-body wave functions characterized by the formation of on-site orbital angular momentum moments. The research encompasses orbital superfluidity in various lattices which exhibit collinear ordering (e.g., staggered and stripe-like), non-collinear ordering, and ''frustrated'' distributions of orbital angular momentum moments. For fermionic orbital systems, the research will focus on the honeycomb lattice, which is a p_xy-orbital counterpart of graphene. The second research topic is the study of large spin physics with cold fermions.  Particular attention is paid to spin-3/2 systems which possess a generic SO(5) symmetry without fine tuning.  The symmetry gives rise to important consequences such as the protected degeneracy in collective excitations, new properties of the quantum Monte-Carlo sign problem, the quintet pairing superfluidity, and the four-fermion quartetting superfluidity. Planned investigations include quantum magnetism in the spin-3/2 systems and other large spin systems as well, such as the pseudospin-1 systems and the spin-5/2 systems.  The research will provide new ideas on exotic orbital superfluidity, orbital exchange physics, and emergent quantum magnetic states. It also suggests new directions for future experiments. Knowledge gained from this research deepens our understanding on strong correlation physics in both cold atom and condensed matter systems.This research lies at the interface between condensed matter and cold atom physics and will benefit both fields. Students will receive training in the application of the symmetry principles and the research will stimulate students to develop broad interests and skills in the frontiers of strongly correlated systems. Aspects of the research, particularly the underlying theoretical techniques, form part of the subject matter of the advanced physics courses being developed by the PI at his university.NONTECHNICAL SUMMARY:This award supports theoretical research and education that seeks to predict new states of matter composed of ultracold atoms in artificial crystals of light. Researchers have found that atoms can be trapped in modulated laser beams much like electrons are trapped in the force fields of atomic nuclei in a crystalline solid. Electrons have two internal configurations; these are related to their magnetic properties. Atoms can have many more internal configurations, leading to possible new states of matter that have no counterparts in conventional materials, but have intriguing properties and may display interesting phenomena. The research develops theories to explain the novel quantum mechanical properties of these cold atoms in crystals of light. The theories provide guidance for new experiments, deepening our understanding of quantum physics and states of matter and leading to new discoveries.  This is fundamental research that lies at the interface of atomic and condensed matter physics. However, systems of cold atoms are intriguing and may hold possibilities for future technologies. Conspicuous among these is the potential to realize powerful new methods of computation based on the principles of quantum mechanics. This research lies at the interface between condensed matter and cold atom physics and will benefit both fields. Students will receive training in the application of the symmetry principles and the research will stimulate students to develop broad interests and skills in the frontiers of strongly correlated systems.

This work is jointly supported by the Division of Materials Research and the Division of Mathematical Sciences. The central theme of the effort  is a better understanding of the properties of macroscopic systems originating in the collective behavior of their microscopic constituents. The methods used range from exact mathematical analysis to computer simulations. These approaches  bridge the gap between rigorous results and applications.Research topics employed by PI and collaborators are varied.  Using mesoscopic free energy functionals allows investigation of periodic states, wetting in mixtures and droplet formation in supersaturated vapor. An ongoing effort continues on fluctuations and large deviations in nonequilibrium stationary states and partial currents. This includes cases where the hydrodynamic scaling is inadequate. Significant advance continue in fundamental studies such as  establishing Fourier?s law of heat conduction in open systems with anharmonic interactions. In quantum statistical physics,  the study of  subsystems of large quantum systems leads to understanding of when these systems have density matrices given by canonical Gibbs measures. In some cases, such as the study of ionization of model quantum systems in time periodic fields,  there are applications to laser induced transitions in atoms and molecules. Beyond physics, researchers also  apply statistical mechanical methods to the mathematical study of epidemics taking into account correlations as well as saturation effects on networks. Extension of these techniques to models of population dynamics and ecology involves derivation of reaction-diffusion equations via scaling limits and these are planned investigations.The  research activities are  highly interdisciplinary, bringing together physicists, mathematicians, chemists and those working in theoretical areas of the biological and social sciences. The expected applications are in material science, complex fluids and in biological systems. The project also includes the organization of two conferences every year in which both core subjects and new developments in statistical mechanics are discussed in a collegial atmosphere. Graduate students, postdocs and minority scientists are involved and present talks on their work and interact with established researchers in the field. The conferences also serve as an opportunity for professional networking  and can lead to new collaborations.

The conferences also serve as an opportunity for professional networking  and can lead to new collaborations.","Tomova's research centers on Heegaard splittings of 3-dimensional manifolds and bridge surfaces for knots in manifolds.  Given a knot in a closed 3-manifold, a bridge surface is a surface that decomposes the manifold into handlebodies and also cuts the knot into simple arcs. In the last year and a half Tomova has proven several important results about the behavior of bridge surfaces. She intends to extend and generalize her results and apply her work to several open problems in the area.With the discovery of the DNS molecule and the recent advent of string theory, the study of knots has come to the forefront of modern science. Knot Theory is a subarea of Topology which studies the properties of knotted strings and is the main area of interest of Maggy Tomova. Her study of knots also requires an understanding of 3-manifolds, objects that locally look like 3-dimensional space.","Phylogenetic trees, which depict the genealogical relationships of organisms to each other, are a key tool for organizing and analyzing information about biological diversity. Trees are used by many researchers in comparative biology and the demand for them is high. The proposed research will take advantage of the phenomenal breadth of data in the GenBank molecular sequence database (currently including sequences from 185,000 species, or some 10% of all species known to science) to build an electronic repository of one billion phylogenetic trees. The goal of this research is to build a very large number of phylogenetic trees and then construct simple search and retrieval tools to match these trees to any query list of species in which a user may be interested.The primary impact of this research will be outside of the phylogenetics research community. Users of phylogenetic trees span most areas of modern biology: epidemiologists, genomicists, functional morphologists, conservation biologists, and community ecologists, to name a few. A repository of molecular phylogenies built using a consistent methodology, and satisfying prescribed minimal levels of statistical confidence, will provide users a level of consistency needed for strong inferences within and between comparative biological studies."],["Achievement;

GaME is a method for applying cognitive science metaphor theory toward the design of computer-mediated learning environments. The process uses structure mapping theory to design videogame worlds aligned with science concepts. This is a rigorous specification procedure for mapping relational structure from targeted concept to game world. GaME design translates a targeted concept into a game system, game play, and game goal. Because the relational structure of the game world is designed as an analog of the targeted conceptual domain, players begin to construct mental models of the targeted concept during interactive gameplay. This makes learning concrete and embodied. Gameplay experiences are designed to guide the learner to discover the relational structure of the targeted concept. This gameplay is a readiness activity for preparing the learner for subsequent instruction. The primary objective of the Cyber-Enabled Teaching and Learning through Game-based, Metaphor Enhanced Learning Objects (CyGaMEs) project is to empirically test this application of cognitive science theory. Aptly designed videogame worlds will provide common experience that prepares educators and their learners to achieve success. CyGaMEs employs cognitive science, informatic sciences, and analysis methodologies to enhance control over what games do: Engage learning through doing, discovery, and inquiry. While each player takes an idiosyncratic route, applied structure mapping theory ensures that gameplay exploration proceeds toward the learning goal.  Selene: A Lunar Creation GaME is the core of CyGaMEs research. This project will: (a) complete, refine and test existing Selene prototype, (b) collect GaME data representing perceptions and learning, (c) develop and refine new methods and metrics for assessing motivation, engagement, and achievement within instructional videogames, and (d) integrate GaME data collection and assessment within a cyber-enabled informatics infrastructure.","Institution: Franklin Institute Science Museum PI: Snyder, Steve Project: ARIEL - Augmented Reality for Interpretive and Experiential Learning Proposal No.: DRL-0741659 PROJECT SUMMARY In partnership with the University of Pennsylvania's Graduate School of Education and Carnegie Mellon University's Entertainment Technology Center, the Franklin Institute Science Museum will develop, test, and pilot an exportable and replicable cyberlearning exhibit using two cutting edge technologies: Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR). The exhibit's conceptualization is anchored in the learning research vision of the NSF-funded workshop Cyberinfrastructure for Education and Learning for the Future (Computing Research Association, 2005).  The incorporation of VR and AR technologies into the Franklin Institute's electricity and Earth science exhibits is an innovation of traditional approaches to hands-on learning and will improve the quality of the learning experience for the primary audience of families with children and elementary school groups. The project has implications for future exhibit development and more broadly, will provide new research on learning on how to incorporate cyberlearning efforts into traditional exhibits. Fifteen participating exhibit developers across the ISE field will assist in the evaluation of the new exhibit; receive training on the design and development of VR and AR exhibits for their institutions; and receive full access to the exhibit's new software for implementation at their informal learning sites.  The technology applications will be developed by Carnegie Mellon University's Entertainment Technology Center--leaders in the field in Virtual Reality design and development. Front-end and formative evaluation will be overseen internally by the Franklin Institute. The Institute for Learning Innovation will conduct the summative evaluation. Research will be conducted by the University of Pennsylvania's Graduate School of Education on the effects of AR and VR technologies on exhibit learning.","DRU: Integrated optimization of evacuation and sheltering for hurricanesPI: Rachel Davidson, University of Delaware (UD). Participating Institution: Cornell University.ABSTRACTThe goal of this project is to improve understanding of and decision support for evacuation and mass case sheltering in hurricanes. The task of moving tens or even hundreds of thousands of people from a wide geographic area in only a few days or hours under uncertain, dangerous conditions, getting them to safe locations, and keeping them safe until they can return home is an extraordinarily complicated process, and as Hurricane Katrina made abundantly clear, the stakes are high. Despite a lot of progress, recent events and unchecked population growth in hurricane-prone regions assure us that many challenges remain. The traditional, conservative approach of evacuating everyone thought to be at risk is no longer feasible in many areas in which there are simply too many people and too little transportation capacity. We propose a fundamentally new approach. In the past, math modeling in this application has been limited to estimating the time required to clear a region, assuming many characteristics of the problem are uncontrollable input (e.g., shelter locations). Instead, we will develop sophisticated optimization models with an expanded decision frame that focuses on higher-level objectives, such as minimizing life loss, cost, and inequity, and considers the full range of strategic and operational evacuation and sheltering strategies in meeting those objectives, including for example, vertical evacuation and strategically locating shelters. These models will be developed through a tight interaction between sociologists and engineers to ensure they are firmly grounded in the reality of people?s behavior. For the first time, the models will be based on individual hurricane scenarios instead of conservative aggregations of many events, and they will be dynamic, accounting for the fact that officials can update their decisions as an event unfolds and information about the situation changes. The project has 5 main steps: (1) determine a set of hurricane scenarios for use in evacuation and shelter models such that they appropriately represent the full range of possible events, but are few enough to allow detailed analysis with each; (2) conduct focus groups of key decisionmakers and stakeholders to identify and characterize appropriate decision objectives, constraints, assumptions, and possible evacuation and shelter management strategies; (3) using the focus group input, develop two mathematical optimization models?one long-term strategic and one short-term operational?for evacuation and sheltering decisions; (4) conduct surveys of affected citizens to ensure that the optimization model assumptions and results make sense; and (5) demonstrate the models through case studies in North Carolina and Florida. Any evacuation and sheltering planning effort is only as effective as its weakest link, so it requires a broad range of expertise from marine science, transportation engineering, risk modeling, optimization, and behavioral research collaborating closely. We have assembled this expertise on the project team.This project will help begin to transform the way hurricane evacuation and sheltering are conducted in the U.S., addressing many of the known limitations of the current approach. The new understanding and optimization models developed in this project will help local and state emergency managers better plan for hurricane evacuation and sheltering, thus reducing the deaths, injuries, and unnecessary expense associated with poorly planned or executed response in future hurricanes. By collaborating throughout the project with state and local emergency management departments and the American Red Cross, the key agencies in charge of hurricane evacuation and sheltering, we will ensure that study results are disseminated to practitioners as quickly and effectively as possible. Three graduate students will participate in all aspects of the research, each with at least two of the co-PIs on their committees to ensure tight integration. By providing a substantive example of truly interdisciplinary disaster research, the project will help facilitate the transformation of the well-known Disaster Research Center, historically based in sociology, into an interdisciplinary center. It will also help to launch the new interdisciplinary graduate program in Disaster Science and Management at the University of Delaware.","The Flora of China (FOC) is an international collaborative project, whose goal is to produce the first complete, English-language account of the approximately 31,500 species of Chinese vascular plants. FOC will result in the publication of 50 volumes, including detailed descriptions of all Chinese plants and illustrations of over 60% of them. All of these materials will be freely available for browsing and downloading via the FOC Web site.FOC is already having a major positive impact on the international scientific community. Upon completion, it will be of great importance to the future of plant science, biodiversity conservation, medicine, education, and horticulture. FOC is also enhancing the infrastructure for scientific research and education by promoting international collaborations among institutions in the United States, China, and Europe. FOC is coordinated by the Missouri Botanical Garden in partnership with ten other actively collaborating institutions. Every text in FOC is co-authored by at least one Chinese and at least one non-Chinese botanist, and the project involves the collaboration of at least 300 non-Chinese and 170 Chinese botanists worldwide. Of these, at least 100 botanists, including and graduate and undergraduate students, are from the United States.","MAPPING / CHARACTERIZATION / AND ANALYSIS OF CHANNEL/VALLEY FEATURES ON TITAN- Elongate sinuous features interpreted as fluvial in origin have been identified on Titan in data from all three of Cassini''s imaging instruments - the Cassini Titan Radar Mapp","The proposed workshops will bring together a multi-disciplinary and international array of scholars studying contemporary issues of surveillance and society. In the modern era, issues of security command the attention of policymakers and the general public, both within the U.S. and beyond. Surveillance has become the key mechanism employed in both public and private sectors to contend with the uncertainty raised by threats of terrorism and other criminal activities. With the rise in surveillance apparatuses and security forces, however, public concerns have multiplied, not only about the cost and efficacy of such safeguards, but also about encroachments upon privacy, civil liberties, and public spaces. These tensions have not gone unnoticed by social scientists and humanities scholars studying surveillance.The objectives of these two three-day workshops are 1) to foster interdisciplinary dialogue on contemporary surveillance issues, 2) to map core areas of surveillance research to locate collaborative opportunities and existing research gaps, and 3) to facilitate graduate student training. The choice of participants will provide a balanced representation of both junior and senior scholars, disciplinary training, and international perspectives. The attendees at both workshops will be asked to address a common set of cross-cutting questions aimed at assessing and improving interdisciplinary knowledge on surveillance and society.","Amphibian populations around the world are experiencing declines and mass mortalities at an unprecedented rate. The fungal disease chytridiomycosis is a primary cause of this epidemic, and differential susceptibility among species occurring in similar environments suggests that genetics may determine how individuals respond to infection. Zamudio and Lips will combine field and laboratory studies to test whether variability in immunity genes of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) confer differential survivorship to this emerging infectious disease, and how the disease itself alters the genetic and demographic composition of populations following an outbreak. The proposal focuses on frog populations in Central America where chytridiomycosis lethality is prevalent; however, their findings will be applicable to amphibian populations worldwide.This project will provide a better understanding of how emerging diseases shape adaptive molecular evolution, and how variability in immunity genes contribute to the response to novel disease threats. This research will quantify the molecular effects of this disease in ?real-time?, in addition to the genetic determinants of survivorship, resulting in useful epidemiological predictions for other populations or species that have yet to be exposed to the disease.","ABSTRACT: The United States over the past two decades has seen an explosion of patent awards across a wide variety of technologies, and a dramatic increase in the volume of patent litigation between rivals. Numerous commentators have suggested that the proliferation of these awards, known as  patent thickets , has had socially detrimental consequences since overlapping intellectual property rights may make it difficult for inventors to commercialize new innovations. Patent pools, which can be defined as formal or informal organizations where for-profit firms share patent rights with each other and third parties, have been proposed as a way in which firms can address these  patent thicket  problems. Patent pools have been most plentiful and well established for decades in the information technology and communications industries. In the past few years, the biomedical research community has expressed increasing interest in patent pools as a potential solution for increasingly prevalent patent licensing issues in biotechnology-related fields. This project builds on the existing work on patent pools, trying to understand how the issues faced in the biomedical industries are similar and different to the issues in information technology and communication. The project combines empirical and theoretical research in this endeavor in an academically rigorous manner. The project is deepening our understanding of a crucial  knowledge-sharing organization , an institution, like a standard-setting organizations or open source project, where firms can strategically share knowledge. BROADER IMPACTS For scientists and others interested in innovation policy, this project advances understanding of how patent thicket problems can be addressed, and the strategies that are most likely to be effective (as well as more problematic approaches). The project leaders are ensuring that the findings of the study are diffused in a variety of outreach efforts, in order to insure that the ideas can have the most impact. This takes several forms. First, the project leaders are involving practitioners as well as life scientists in the academic conference that is being organized on this topic. As in earlier projects, the project leaders are participating in the public policy process, explaining their findings. Finally, the project leaders are disseminating the ideas more broadly through outreach to the popular press.","This empirical study examines the variety of materials used and the myriad of teaching strategies employed by U.S. high school mathematics teachers in their effort to prepare students for later success in college calculus, a requirement for most STEM majors. Designed as a retrospective cohort study, we use 12,000 college calculus students' histories to predict performance while controlling for demographic differences. This study has the capability to both reveal the most promising educational practices in mathematics, including technological innovations, and to assess the degree of match between high school math and college calculus courses, both traditional and reform based.","Several small-scale experimental studies in classrooms by Star and Rittle-Johnson demonstrate the value of comparison in mathematics learning: Students who learned by comparing and contrasting alternative solution methods made greater gains in conceptual knowledge, procedural knowledge, and flexibility than those who studied the same solution methods one at a time. This study will extend that prior work by developing, piloting, and then evaluating the impact of comparison on students' learning of mathematics in a full-year algebra course. Sixty Algebra I teachers will participate in a randomized controlled trial of the contrasting-examples instructional approach, using a delayed treatment design.","The University of Colorado is establishing a Distributed Center for STEM Education Research and Transformation that integrates education projects across the campus.  The Center addresses the three themes outlined in the National Academy of Science report  Rising Above the Gathering Storm . These are: (1) Teachers in K-12 education (10,000 Teachers, 10 Million Minds), (2) Research (Sowing Seeds), and (3) Higher Education (Best and Brightest).  This Distributed Center involves eight traditional departments in three colleges and schools, including: Education, Life Sciences, Mathematics, Physical Sciences, and Engineering.  Existing education projects being integrated into the center include: ADVANCE (Increasing the Participation and Advancement of Women in Academic Science and Engineering Careers); Course Curriculum and Laboratory Improvement projects; Robert Noyce Teaching Scholarship project; Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship projects; and Research and Evaluation on Education in Science and Engineering projects.","Scientists, inventors, writers, and other creators have attested to the importance of inspiration in the creative process. In contrast, creativity researchers have generally dismissed the concept of inspiration, arguing that ascription of creative insight to the intervention of a supernatural source ( muse ) is outmoded myth. However, it is possible to reconcile creators' accounts of inspiration with contemporary science. Specifically, consistent with creators' accounts, inspiration is posited to be an effect of creative insight, not its cause; inspiration is posited to be a motivational state that is aroused in response to a creative insight and that compels the individual to translate the creative insight into a creative product. This perspective exposes an important gap in the research literature. Creativity researchers have made considerable progress in identifying the cognitive, neurological, and contextual origins of creative insight (thus debunking the notion of Muse) but have largely ignored the state of inspiration that promotes the translation of creative insights into creative products. This oversight is striking, because the failure to translate creative ideas into tangible products is likely to be among the most important obstacles to innovation. This project involves three primary goals. The first goal is to develop methods for the assessment of inspiration and to provide evidence of their validity. Several methods of assessment are being developed, including self-report questionnaires and objective indicators derived, for instance, from digital video of nonverbal behaviors and from electronic monitoring of the creative process. The second goal is to demonstrate that inspiration is a robust predictor of creativity and other socially valued outcomes, including work productivity and efficiency. Several types of creative activity are examined, including invention, scientific writing, and the writing of poetry. In each case, creativity is assessed objectively (e.g., receipt of patents) or through a peer-review process. The third goal is to establish the functional significance of inspiration by integrating it with contemporary theories of personality and human motivation. For instance, the personality traits that predict the creativity of an initial insight are expected to be fundamentally different from the traits that predict the tendency to become inspired to actualize the insight. In addition, mysterious aspects of the subjective experience of inspiration, such as the feeling that one is functioning as the mouthpiece of a power beyond oneself, are expected to be explained by the involvement of implicit (unconscious) processes.This project will have important impacts beyond advancing the motivation, inspiration, and creativity research literatures. For instance, the findings will be widely disseminated in the form of research articles, book chapters, and conference presentations; tools for the assessment of inspiration, known to be predictive of creativity, productivity, and efficiency, will be available for use in the workplace and in educational settings; and policy makers and others concerned with societal adaptation to changing physical and sociopolitical environments will be equipped with well-validated models of the processes through which innovative and transformative ideas are translated into concrete products and solutions.","This proposed project is an empirical study that falls within the contextual research strand of the REESE program.  The aim is to conduct research about STEM education relative to achievement gaps that exist between minority and disadvantaged students and their non-minority counterparts. The outcomes of this study will help in addressing the convergence of several trends that may exact increasing costs to individuals on the lower end of the gap, the economy, and to social and political ideas.   The achievement gap is a deceptively complex scientific problem that will increasingly require studying the origin and evolution of gaps from earliest childhood.  In that regard, this study will integrate research trends in the developmental sciences, the cognitive and neurosciences and economics, and education research and other strands of social science to develop interventions to address gaps in more efficient ways. The first large nationally representative longitudinal data collection will be used for this study.  This large database includes information from nine months to grade eight that will be used to test and compare the leading hypotheses about the origin and evolution of gaps.  To meet the challenge of turning such data into credible evidence that might inform intervention plans and further research, two statistical estimation strategies (growth and econometric models), information from supporting meta-analysis, and an extensive advisory network of experts will be used to conduct the study.  The research will focus on: (1) Building better theoretical and empirical research models directed toward understanding how these gaps develop from conception to school entry; (2) Identifying effective strategies and inventions that might efficiently narrow gaps prior to school entry; (3) Building better explanations about why gaps are so difficult to close during schooling; (4) formulating stronger suggestions about why gaps for some minority groups expand during schooling, while gaps for other minority students narrow; and (5) Identifying the conditions associated with significant positive changes in learning trajectories during schooling for the small proportion of minority and disadvantaged students who narrow their score differences with white advantaged students.Broader Impacts: The study is likely to advance knowledge and discovery in the field in that it brings together researchers from many fields to examine ways to better understand the achievement gap in STEM areas.  The results could benefit education stakeholders interested in improving STEM education for all students.  Potentially, this study could inform and influence current policy considerations regarding mandatory pre-school enrollment, and in that regard could be transformative.  State and local policymakers will assist with dissemination as well as national outlets established through earlier studies.","This project is supporting expansion and continuation of a successful series of faculty development workshops run by the Geosciences Division of the Council on Undergraduate Research (GeoCUR). These workshops are held in conjunction with annual and sectional meetings of the Geological Society of America (GSA) and the American Geophysical Union (AGU), and at the national meeting of the Association of American Geographers (AAG). They are designed to help faculty develop and sustain undergraduate research programs. This project is making these workshops available to a wider audience, as well as serving as a means of leadership development for rising and current geoscience faculty. Alumni of past GeoCUR workshops are now actively involved in leadership positions within CUR, and they are facilitators for this series of workshops.","The Inland Northwest Community Access Network (TINCAN), the Puget Sound Center for Teaching, Learning and Technology (PSCTLT), and Reel Grrls (a community media center) are partnering to involve 6th and 7th grade middle school girls in science-focused after-school club activities in 10 schools in Seattle and Spokane, Washington. The Science Journalism Pathways to STEM Careers project is engaging girls in science journalism through information and communication technologies (ICT) to investigate and publish information about local science issues of interest to their communities. The ICT focus is video, multimedia, and the Internet. Girls are also conducting hands-on activities and interviewing STEM professionals to learn issue-related science content. The goals of the project are to (1) increase girls' ICT fluency, (2) increase girls' science literacy, (3) increase girls' interest in STEM careers, and (4) increase STEM content in non-science courses taught by social studies teachers who manage the after-school clubs.","[This proposal is part of a funded CRP from the EuroCORES HumVIB competition.]Can electoral institutions overcome the political consequences of social exclusion and poverty? What role did political parties play in incorporating the working classes into the electorates of European democracies? And, why are so many Americans, particularly the working and lower middle people, still alienated from participation in their countrys electoral processes? This research begins with the premise that these questions reflect different perspectives on the same political phenomenon: The context of electoral competition especially the rules governing legislative elections and their interactions with the geographic distribution income shapes the incentives of political actors to mobilize and incorporate low-income and working-class citizens. The proposed research contributes to a recommended Collaborative Research Proposal from the EuroCORES HumVIB competition. Earlier accounts of the relationship redistributive policy emphasize a stark division between multimember district (MMD) electoral rules and single-member district (SMD) rules (e.g., Iversen &amp; Soskice 2006, Persson &amp; Tabellini 2000). These accounts, however, miss the important modifying effect of electoral context - specifically, the geographic distribution of citizens of different types - on the effect of electoral rules in structuring legislators' policy-making incentives. The intellectual merits of this proposal lie, therefore, in the recognition that given the national context in which elections are held - in particular, the geographic distribution of income - the electoral institutions of contemporary democracies may undermine the opportunities for those societies to achieve their democratic ideals.As part of a European Science Foundation Collaborative Research Scheme (EUROCORES), the proposed research will contribute to a broadly collaborative and highly integrated project that is motivated by questions about voter turnout. The proposed research will contribute to the theoretical development and data collection exercises of this larger project.","Eye tracking has become a widespread tool throughout the cognitive sciences and has attracted particular attention as a behavioral measurement tool for children with developmental disabilities. However, there are no standardized quantitative tools for assessing broadly defined attention skills in young children, and there is a lack of analysis techniques that would allow gaze patterns to be compared across individuals, across populations, or for a single individual across time.  This study will develop methods of quantitatively measuring attentional capacities by (1) designing a Visual Attention Assessment Suite (VAAS) which examines the interaction and impact of particular features of scenes on visual attention; (2) constructing novel computational analysis techniques for comparing gaze patterns across individuals, populations, and time; (3) validating these techniques against both standard behavioral assessment protocols and through an embodied modeling approach to ensure that our models capture the behaviorally important aspects of gaze.  The regulation of attention has been hypothesized as one of the fundamental factors affecting early development of children with autism.  This project will develop quantitative measures that can be used as diagnostic and prognostic indicators and to evaluate the effectiveness of particular treatment approaches.  This project represents the first integrated and interdisciplinary attempt to develop a much needed full-scale diagnostic instrument that operates purely through eye-tracking, computational techniques, and individual modeling.   Although our primary focus is the interpretation of gaze data with respect to autism, eye tracking is used extensively in psychology, primatology, usability studies, marketing, and human-computer interaction experiments.  The models and analysis tools constructed under this project will be equally applicable to these other domains.  This project also has the potential to produce novel methods of assessing attentional abnormalities in other developmental disorders (e.g., mental retardation, attention deficit disorder, specific learning disabilities), novel educational assessment methods of pre-kindergarten readiness, as well as to develop training methods for teaching clinicians and educators behavioral assessment using a robot as a model illustrating various attentional patterns in children with disabilities.","Engineering - Chemical (53)Current engineering education embraces computer-based visualizations and simulations to foster student learning. There is evidence that these technological advances, while improving student understanding of complex theories, have simultaneously led to a decrease in opportunities for students to explore forces, causal factors, and effects in the real world. The result is that diminished opportunity to physically experience produces a diminished ability to perceive among our undergraduate students. In this project, laboratory exercises are being developed to reconnect undergraduate chemical engineering students with the physical world. The new lab experiences emphasize somatic opportunities that promote physical insight and engineering judgment. These activities are designed to stimulate independent thought and creativity while promoting use of the human senses, tactile learning, tinkering, and data interpretation. The project's impact on student learning is being rigorously assessed through qualitative and quantitative measures. Project results are being broadly disseminated through presentations at conferences and through the development of a project web site.","INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGY AND LIFE SCIENCE RESEARCH ENABLING ROBOTIC AND HUMAN SPACE EXPLORATION NASA''s mission is to pioneer the future in space exploration / scientific discovery / and aeronautics research.

I2U2 maintains a growing online portfolio of educational laboratories for a diverse range of disciplines and provides tools and support services to assist developers in creating these educational resources. These laboratories break new ground by using the national Grid cyberinfrastructure for education in the same way that science increasingly uses the Grid.   I2U2 collaboratories take two similar but distinct shapes. ?e-Labs,? delivered as Web-based portals accessible in the classroom and at home, are implemented with the ever-expanding capabilities of Web-based media. ?i-Labs,? are delivered as interactive interfaces typically located within science museums and similar public venues.   I2U2 will deploy and maintain itself as a ?virtual organization? to provide support for participants across project boundaries and from many different home institutions who share a common interest in developing Grid-based education and outreach resources, and who seek to communicate, coordinate and reach their target audience through the Internet and the Grid.   I2U2 will also extensively evaluate and assess the effectiveness and use of the portfolio of science education laboratories.","This study is intended to develop better understanding of why changes in reform-based practices in higher education are slow to develop.  The project aims to increase understanding of the relationship between mental models of faculty about effective pedagogy in STEM fields and the extent of consensus about such pedagogy. The research will also examine individual and institutional factors that may influence mental models and consensus and the individual and group level factors that are related to teaching practices and changes in cognitive structure and consensus over time. The study will use cognitive frameworks to explain institutional inertia and will develop methodological approaches to examine several different units of analysis using both cognitive and cultural frameworks.  The investigators will create an evaluation design that will be tested in higher education institutions.  It will describe the mental models held by individual faculty about effective pedagogy, describe the groups that have consensus on these structures, and describe how individuals and institutions vary in teaching approaches.   The study will measure changes in faculty views of pedagogical practices over time by following faculty over time.  Data will be gathered from faculty in math, life science and physical sciences over a three year period. The primary source of data will be a survey instrument given in the first and third year. There will also be in-dept interviews with subsets of faculty.","The study of earth's topography has fundamental impacts on society, from flood and landslide prevention and control to the understanding of climate change impacts, management of land-use practices, as well as design of roads and other man-made projects in an environmentally sustainable way.  The recent availability of high resolution (0.5 m spacing) digital topography from airborne laser swath mapping and ground-based lidar offers opportunities to develop a new class of environmental predictive models that explicitly incorporate important features of the landscape and thus enhance the accuracy of predictions. The goal of this project is to develop modern computational geometric image analysis methodologies applicable to hydrologic and eco-geomorphologic hazard prediction and control. Specifically, the project studies high-resolution, multiscale, and dynamic topography with the goal of extracting channel networks, channel banks and shapes, floodplains and hazard-relevant features such as landslide prone areas and service roads which contribute to increased sediment production and thus stream habitat deterioration.  The mathematical and computational techniques to be exploited and developed come from the area of geometric non-linear partial differential equations and energy formulations, combined with differential and computational geometry. Specifically, a combination of methodologies ranging from geometric scale-space theory to singularity theory and geometric variational principles, combined with optimal algorithms for computing special curves on surfaces, will be exploited to derive a complete and automatic analysis of the topography at multiple relevant scales.","ADAPTIVE CONTROL WITH A PRIORI GUARANTEED PERFORMANCE BOUNDS AND ROBUSTNESS/STABILITY MARGINS The objective of the proposed effort is to develop verifiable robust adaptive control architectures and relevant metrics for validating their stability / perform","****NON-TECHNICAL ABSTRACT****This Small Grant for Exploratory Research enhances research opportunities for minority students at a Historically Black University.  It will allow them to contribute to the discovery process, including experimental research and the exchange of ideas at the frontier of science.  The project will attempt to elucidate whether an interpretation for the transport behavior of electrons in bismuth (Bi) nanowires when subjected to high magnetic fields is also valid for the recently observed behavior exhibited by charge carriers in bulk single crystal Bi.  The observed effects in bulk Bi have been interpreted as being due to the electrons in bulk Bi behaving like electrons constrained to moving only in a thin layer (i.e., exhibiting the fractional charge of a collective quantum state of 2 dimensional electrons).  The transport behavior in Bi nanowires has been interpreted as arising from electrons near the surface of the wire (i.e., the surface states).  However, there are similarities between the magnetic field dependent transport measurements of Bi nanowires and bulk Bi.  Low temperature electronic transport measurements in magnetic fields on bulk Bi will be performed.  These measurements are designed to reveal the possible contributions from surface states and fractional charge.  This timely project could be transformative in our understanding of Bi in the quantum limit and lead to future technologies.  ****TECHNICAL ABSTRACT****This Small Grant for Exploratory Research enhances research opportunities for minority students at a Historically Black University.  It will allow them to contribute to the discovery process, including experimental research and the exchange of ideas at the frontier of science.  The project will attempt to elucidate whether surface states could explain the recently observed magneto-transport behavior in bulk Bi.  Recent experimental studies of the Nernst effect and Hall effect of bulk Bi in the quantum limit (magnetic fields larger than 9 Tesla) have been interpreted in terms of charge fractionalization, an unusual collective quantum state seen only in two-dimensional electron gases.  Absorption peaks with the same Shubnikov-deHaas period of 0.03/T have been observed in the magnetoresistance and thermopower of Bi nanowires both below and above the quantum limit of 9 T.  In this case an interpretation in terms of surface states related to a spin-orbit surface interaction was proposed. Measurements of the magnetoresistance and Hall effect of thin samples of bulk single-crystal bismuth in magnetic fields up to 45 T will be performed.  These measurements are designed to reveal possible contributions by surface states and fractional charge, allow evaluation of their properties such as effective masses, and permit evaluation of the relative importance of surface effects and electronic transport by bulk-like electrons and holes in bulk Bi.  This timely project could be transformative in our understanding of Bi in the quantum limit and lead to future technologies.","SciGirls, produced by Twin Cities Public Television, is a new PBS 13-part half-hour television series with accompanying Web and outreach activities targeted to girls ages 8 - 13-year olds.  The intended impacts are to 1) to foster a greater interest in STEM among girls ages 8 to 13 and their parents, with girls from diverse communities the highest priority; 2) connect girls to existing, quality STEM education opportunities in their communities; and 3) contribute to the growing body of research to deepen understanding of the most effective ways to engage girls in STEM activities and encourage them to pursue STEM careers.  The project?s two strategic partners are the National Girls Collaborative Project (NGCP) in Seattle, and The Franklin Institute in Philadelphia.  The NGCP will link SciGirls TV with its network of 500 community-based science programs for girls, and The Franklin Institute will help form an affiliate network of science museums to implement SciGirls TV outreach activities.  In addition to the broadcasts on PBS Plus, the videos will be distributed via online streaming and DVD?s, as well as via versions that can be downloaded to portable video players.  The most significant web component will be a social networking feature that will allow girls interested in science to connect with others across the nation.  Barbara Flagg of Multimedia Research will conduct formative evaluation of the first rough cuts, and a subsequent summative evaluation of the completed programs and of the social networking web site.","THERMAL EMISSION ANALYSIS OF EXTINCT COMET CANDIDATES AND M-TYPE ASTEROIDS We propose thermal and compositional analysis of thermal emission spectra (5.2 / 38 microns) of two groups of small bodies: Extinct comet candidates and M-type asteroids. Together","Morgan State University and Baltimore City Public School System (BCPSS) are core partners for the MSP-Start  BRAIN-STEM  project which is building the necessary institutional infrastructure, in both the university and the school system, to implement activities that integrate mathematical and biological concepts in a manner that can be incorporated into high school mathematics and science courses.  From a content perspective, they are focusing on discrete mathematics and genomics as material that is interesting, engaging, and at an appropriate level for success.  They are conducting a needs analysis in the BCPSS by collecting and analyzing student achievement and teacher characteristic data in grades 9 - 12 math and science.

There currently is a gap in understanding of how different types of individual innovative activities come to be linked sequentially in a chain of events that ultimately may produce new commercial products or processes. Similarly, little is known about the organizational and institutional determinants of the overall productivity of linked sequences of such innovative events over time and space. This project analyzes the economic, organizational, and institutional determinants of the probability of a successful transition between such innovative events, and ultimately, toward commercially successful innovation, at each stage along the innovation chain. Data gleaned from patents, scientific publications, literature and patent citations, licensing agreements, research funding, and collaborative agreements are being used to construct a novel database of spatial and temporal linkages between activities and entities at each stage along an innovation chain, and to develop qualitative and quantitative indicators of knowledge and technology flows within these chains of linked events. The database is being constructed using case studies of nano-electronic innovations in the semiconductor industry, and applications of biotechnology innovations in the pharmaceutical industry. This research focus is inspired by efforts within these two mature high technology industries to experiment with novel strategies to integrate emerging technologies into their innovation pipelines. The variety and breadth of organizational, institutional, and funding strategies used to coordinate innovative activities in these industries provides a rich and varied set of data to be used in developing indicators and understanding of knowledge and technology flows. Broader Impacts: Although this research focuses on the semiconductor and pharmaceutical industries, the analysis should also have a broader impact in the development of more generally applicable stylized facts about determinants of the innovative process. The indicators of knowledge and technology flows being constructed are available for use as data in estimation of econometric models of determinants of the probability of a given R&amp;D project successfully transitioning to various possible types of successor projects along an innovation chain, and ultimately, resulting in commercialization. Analysis of this database using a structural model provides empirical insights into the economic, organizational and structural factors that maximize the probability of success for innovation-related projects. These insights are a significant contribution to the development of a science of science and innovation policy. Further, decision makers in both the public and private sectors should be able to use these results to help choose among different possible organizational, institutional, and funding strategies, and improve the odds of successful innovation resulting from supported projects.","Computer Engineering (32)This project involves the running of the Information Assurance Capacity Building Program (IACBP), intended to improve the capacity of Minority-Serving Institutions (MSIs), including both Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HCBUs) and Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSIs), to offer high quality Information Assurance (IA) education and a specialization in Computer Forensics Science. The IACBP aids MSIs to develop IA curricula under advisement and with academic enrichment from established leaders in the field, leading to the implementation of new IA activities at the MSIs. The objectives are to build new capacity or expand existing capacity to offer IA courses and programs at MSIs not currently designated as Centers of Academic Excellence (CAE) in IA Education; to expand the research opportunities in IA; and to help build expertise in Cyber Forensics Science. As a two-year workshop, the program gives a two-week session during the first year that presents IA theory and practice, and then gives a three-day follow-up session during the second year where participants present their initial outcomes and results to their peers. This method integrates three main components: technological knowledge, pedagogical support and an individual curriculum development plan.","The research objective of the project is the design of a photovoltaic (PV) grid-connected system for remote rural health clinics in Egypt. The work encompasses data collection of load and weather parameters, selection and comparison of PV grid-connected system configurations, modeling and simulation of PV-grid-connected operation, design of power management system, economic assessment of the proposed system and specification of the proposed system.This project is being supported by the U.S.-Egypt Joint Board For Science and Technology which is funding both the U.S. and Egyptian sides of the collaboration.  Intellectual Merit:The project represents a natural continuation of the scientific cooperation between the Electronics Research Institute and the University of Nevada in the new research area of photovoltaic (PV) energy as an alternative and clean energy source. The project will focus on a detailed study of PV-grid connected energy system configuration, components, mode of operation and control, and costs. The second main objective of the project is to study the utilization of PV grid-connected energy systems to supply remote rural emergency health clinics in Egypt with electrical energy. This includes assessing the required size of the PV system. Broader Impacts:The project's objectives are to develop new approaches to energy systems that will provide reliable service to remote hospitals in Egypt where grid power is currently unreliable. Moreover, the approach to PV grid-connected energy systems will encourage government and private investment in PV energy in Egypt. This will provide currently underserved areas with access to reliable clean energy while saving fossil fuels and protecting the environment from harmful emissions. In addition, some of the developed solutions will benefit states with remote sparsely populated areas, like Nevada. As part of the effort young Egyptian scientists will be trained in the use of sophisticated software for power system analysis that is not available in their institutions.","THE ROLE OF WATER IN THE EARLY FORMATION OF MARS: WET MAGMA OCEAN CRYSTALIZATION / THE GROWTH OF A WATER ATMOSPHERE / AND RETENTION OF WATER IN THE MANTLE Introduction: On Mars crater densities indicate that crust in both hemispheres dates from the early","LIGHT RUNNERS STEREO SPACE MISSION E/PO  Light Runners  is a touring E/PO program that provides unprecedented access to STEREO space mission imagery data to the blind and visually handicapped as well as sighted populations across the country. The program","Health care delivery in the U.S. is experiencing severe and worsening problems.  Costs are higher than in other countries and continue to increase, yet the overall quality of care delivered is not improving.  Increasing demand for health care as baby boomers become elderly is further straining the care delivery system.  Thus, dramatic changes are needed in health care delivery in the U.S. over the next decade.  One proposed solution is computer systems designed for health care, called health information technology (HIT).  These HIT systems, particularly electronic health records (EHR) that store patients? medical history and their interactions with physicians, promise significant improve¬ments in quality, effectiveness and productivity of care delivery.  Yet simply installing HIT without significantly changing existing work processes is unlikely to produce needed results. What is needed is an in-depth under¬standing of how HIT and process design techniques should be conceptualized and applied in health care. This project develops theories that can transform health care delivery processes in the U.S., through a deep understanding of the changes needed to make effective use of HIT and process design techniques.  The questions we address are: What capabilities does an EHR provide and which are used by health care organizations?  Which characteristics of the health care context, including characteristics of countries, the physician and nursing professions, and health care organizations, enable and inhibit the ability of health care organizations to take advantage of what EHR systems provide?  What are the dynamics of change by which EHR capabilities affect care delivery processes?  How and why do new EHR systems improve or reduce the quality and productivity of health care delivery processes?  How do health care organizations and individuals working in them need to change to make the most effective use of new EHR systems?  Answers to these questions will provide the knowledge needed to transform health care delivery processes in the U.S.This team will conduct multiple case studies of EHR implementation in health care organizations to understand the dynamics of change as the EHR implementation alters health care delivery processes.  The case studies will be carried out at our partner organizations, Fallon Clinic, UMass Memorial Health Care, Canada?s single payer system in British Columbia, and two of Israel?s four Health Fund systems.  These four settings provide different health care contexts, enabling us to observe and learn from their differences.  Improving the quality of health care delivered in the U.S. as well as reducing its cost has become a critically important societal goal.  The health care system is reaching a breaking point, and needs to be changed.  Simplistic solutions, however, will not work. Solutions require an interdisciplinary approach and the holistic, in-depth understanding of the variety of forces influencing change that will be studied in this project.  The work produced will provide a foundation for a larger community of researchers transforming HIT and process design ideas to solve health care delivery problems.","Computer Science (31)Scholarships for both undergraduate and graduate students are being given by this institution to students seeking degrees in a broad-based Information Assurance (IA) program with a special focus on computer forensics.

A second goal is to address a critical state problem with global significance ? understanding and forecasting the effects of climate change on water supply and water quality in arid regions. Climate changes are affecting natural environments around the world. In New Mexico, climate changes are altering processes associated with water supply, which sustains New Mexico?s economy and determines, to a large extent, the quality of life. This multidisciplinary effort will transform climate change science and policymaking in New Mexico by providing the tools required for quantitative, science-driven discussion of difficult water policy options facing the state, and will create a citizenry that is informed about climate change and its impact on natural resources.Project Major Foci: The research will address the influence of large scale atmospheric circulations on regional and local atmospheric processes and explore how hydrometeorological fluctuations propagate into changes in surface flows downstream.Given the uncertainties associated with global coupled model projections across southwestern North America, the research will examine the covariability of precipitation and land anomalies in these projections as they relate to the Southwest. Land-atmosphere feedbacks associated with snowpack at high elevation may be of first-order importance in modulating the transition from winter to summer precipitation in the current climate. Thus, characterizing and properly simulating the full seasonal hydrological cycle in regions with winter snowpack is critical for process-based analysis and for projections of stream flows in New Mexico, motivating the proposal?s focus on the upstream portion of the Rio Grande in northern New Mexico.Intellectual MeritThe impacts of climate change on New Mexico are profound and are altering processes associated with the water supply for the region. Proposed research infrastructure improvements will enable scientists to observe processes at the watershed scale and to understand the effects of climate change on water supply, water sources, and water quality in arid regions. New Mexico EPSCoR proposes to strategically invest in building a robust hydrologic infrastructure to develop a better understanding of the relationship of high elevation events to downstream water supplies. This capability is needed for meaningful forecasting and decision support. New cyberinfrastructure will support multi-scale modeling and rapid delivery of climate change data and information to scientists, educators, decision-makers, and the public.Broader ImpactsNew Mexico EPSCoR research foci are of global scientific and societal importance. The investment in research, cyberinfrastructure and human infrastructure will establish New Mexico as a laboratory for climate change and a model for science-based public policy that can serve science and society. Education, outreach and diversity programs will create a citizenry that is informed about climate change and its impact on natural resources.","PI: Gurmukh (Guri) S. Johal, Purdue UniversityCo-PI: Clifford F. Weil, Purdue UniversityCo-PI: James. W. Moyer, North Carolina State UniversityCo-PI: Peter J. Balint-Kurti, North Carolina State UniversityPlant disease resistance (R) genes encode proteins that respond to pathogen invasion by triggering a rapid, localized  hypersensitive reaction  (HR), in which host tissue immediately adjacent to the site of infection undergoes programmed cell death. Although, HR is a fundamental part of the immune response in plants, very little is known about the genes that trigger, signal, execute, and then contain it. Exhaustive mutagenesis screens have been conducted in Arabidopsis, but have turned up only a few genes linked to HR, possibly because of genetic redundancy or lethality of HR mutants. An alternate and potentially huge resource of HR variation is available in natural germplasm.  If effectively tapped and delineated, this resource has the potential to advance considerably our understanding of HR . By taking advantage of a constitutive-active allele of the Rp1 gene, which confers resistance to the common rust disease of maize, we have demonstrated that the maize germplasm contains vast amounts of variation capable of impacting HR. This project will test the broad use of an innovative approach, which looks for naturally occurring alleles that suppress mutant phenotypes to rapidly detect and explore natural variation underlying HR. Using this approach, one HR-modulating locus (Hrml1) has already been identified and mapped in a preliminary test using the IBM population of maize; this QTL will be cloned.  In addition, many more QTL will be identified and characterized by broadening the screen to the 5000-line Nested Association Mapping (NAM) population currently available to the maize community. The broader impacts of the project are many-fold.  First, the approach of discovering and harnessing genetic diversity is likely to be broadly applicable to a large number of important traits in most plant species. Second, an outreach component will bring the uses of biodiversity to middle school curricula (Grades 6-8) and the topics of DNA sequence analysis and quantitative trait analysis to high school curricula, with the development and test of teaching materials that can be widely distributed.  Third, these teaching modules will be developed for and with students from a wide range of cultural, racial and educational backgrounds, and their teachers.  This approach will allow development of several versions of these modules, using different examples, different assessments and different forms of presentation so that they can be applied  effectively in a variety of settings.  The goal is to overturn the stereotype that these subjects are too complex for middle and high school students to grasp, and to prime student to investigate plant diversity and genetics in greater detail later in their education so that they are better able to understand the issues.  These topics are not generally covered in most science curricula at these levels, despite their increasing importance scientifically and socially. The outcomes and biological resources generated by this project will be available through the project website: http://www.Rp1-MAGIC.purdue.edu.","Computer gaming and simulations enjoy great popularity and are used by the military and corporate world to enhance training.

The workshop will be the basis for the development of a research agenda to gain a better of understanding of how gaming and simulations can support learning and assessment in science.","EVOLVING NONLINEAR FORCE-FREE MAGNETIC MODELS OF THE SOLAR CORONA Despite considerable progress in observing the structure and evolution of the solar corona the root causes of many phenomena remain elusive. The dynamics associated with coronal heating pro","This proposal responds to the need for realizing the potential of cyber-infrastructure for education and argues that in order for cyber-enabled learning to be realized and used, three important issues must be addressed: (a) It is critical to be able to characterize what is meant by cyber-enabled learning; (b) multiple approaches to gathering evidence of sophisticated cyber-enabled learning must be developed; and (c) learning must be attributable to participation in the identified cyber-enabled learning. The project, therefore, has three goals: (1) to characterize cyber-enabled learning using a case study; (2) to identify the assessment and psychometric issues related to assessing cyber-enabled learning; and (3) to propose methodological solutions to modeling learning in such complex learning environments. The focus of the stduy is on a substantial case study in geoscience, which employs science content that is accessible to a wide range of the education community, and which draws on known areas of research, particularly scientific visualization: the study of earthquakes, tsunamis, and related phenomena. This project asks: What is the character of analytical reasoning for geoscience within a networked, cyber-infrastructure framework, and what counts as evidence for such reasoning? What assessment and psychometric issues must be addressed? What are the methodological challenges in modeling and assessing learning within this cyber-infrastructure project? For example, how are claims of causality handled in a complex networked and nested learning environment, and what evidence would make such claims credible? This project addresses potentially new concepts by examining the transformative and dynamic nature of cyber-infrastructure.","The Binding Principles, perhaps the most well studied principles in human language, state where in a sentence nominals (e.g., pronouns, common and proper nouns, etc.) may occur, and what they may/may not refer to. Many prominent researchers argue that these principles are part of our innate linguistic endowment because (i) they occur in the vast majority of languages for which we have data, and (ii) children in every language studied to date exhibit them at the very earliest testable ages. This argument for innateness is threatened somewhat by the existence of a handful of languages, e.g., Thai, in which the Binding Principles appear not to hold. If these principles are innate, exceptional languages like Thai should not exist.So why don't Thai speakers obey the Binding Principles? Thai children hold the answer to this puzzle: if Thai children, unlike Thai adults, exhibit knowledge of the Binding Principles at young ages, this will show that the principles are indeed part of our innate linguistic endowment, and that as children mature, they 'unlearn' these principles on the basis of adult input. However, if Thai children show no evidence of the Binding Principles at any stage in development, this will suggest that the principles are not innate. If this is the case, children acquiring other languages (e.g., English) do not have access to these innate principles, and must simply learn them on the basis of experience and other (non-linguistic) mechanisms. This project will test 80 Thai children aged 3yrs-7yrs and 20 adult Thai speakers on six experiments, each targeting a different aspect of the Binding Principles. The project will not only address one of the biggest debates in cognitive science (nature versus nurture), but it will also gather data from an understudied language, as well as establish and foster relations between academic institutions in Thailand and the United States. Moreover, this work will lay the foundation for the development of standards for the acquisition of Thai that may be used for Speech Pathology or educational assessment purposes.","TECHNICAL SUMMARY:This award supports research and education on emergent properties of highly correlated electronic systems. The main thrust of the research undertaken here is the effort at  theoretical characterization of qualitatively new behaviors of interacting electrons (i.e. new states of matter) as well as new regimes of parameters in which familiar states of matter behave in new and different ways. In addition, some of the research explores qualitatively the relation between the microscopic interactions between electrons and the effective parameters that control the macroscopic behavior of solids.The search for new states of matter continues an ongoing effort by the PI in the theory of ''electronic liquid crystals.'' This work is based on an analogy between classical liquid crystals and corresponding phases of strongly interacting electrons.  Electronic liquid crystals are quantum states with behaviors intermediate between a Fermi liquid and a Wigner crystal. Examples of such states have recently been observed experimentally: the anisotropic states (quantum Hall nematics) that are seen in high mobility quantum Hall devices and the metamagnetic nematic phase that has recently been identified in Sr3Ru2O7. The more microscopic issues to be addressed involve the physics of the superconducting Tc. A number of questions are addressed theoretically.  What is it about superconductivity that causes transition temperatures, generally, to be so low, while other orders, such as ferromagnetism, frequently onset at much higher temperatures? Why is there, in the cuprate high temperature superconductors, an ''optimal'' doping at which Tc is maximal ? what is there an excess of in ''overdoped'' cuprates? Are there optimal mesoscale structures for superconductivity, structures that enhance the strength of the electron pairing without too strongly suppressing the superfluid stiffness? The research also seeks to interpret the importance of evidence of wide-spread mesoscale inhomogeneities in the cuprates ? both self-organized (i.e. stripes) and nucleated by disorder. The research is motivated by a need to clarify  whether these observations are complicating details or essential to the mechanism of high temperature superconductivity.The effort undertaken has  broader impacts with  both scientific and educational consequences. Scientifically, there is impact in extending the understanding of the origins of high temperature superconductivity because that opens new theoretical opportunities as well as providing better ability to design materials with this highly desirable property.  Involving students and postdoctoral researchers in the diverse   problems and theoretical techniques used  provides an exceptional training for talented young people. Past students and postdoctoral researchers have gone on to university faculty positions and their own careers in teaching and research and some have found successful positions in high tech companies and a variety of other fields outside of mainstream physics.NONTECHNICAL SUMMARY:This award supports research and education on exotic properties and unexplained electronic states  of unusual materials. The broad thrust of the research undertaken here is the theoretical characterization of qualitatively new behaviors and new states of matter as well as investigating how familiar forms matter can be made to behave in new and different ways. This research explores these unusual states of matter by looking at the behavior of electrons and the microscopic level of the atoms that make up the material and then connecting those behaviors with the large scale properties which are seen in the material as a solid whole.The search for new states of matter continues an ongoing effort by the PI in the theory of ''electronic liquid crystals.'' This work develops theories of why some materials have electrons that are not just quiescently distributed more or less uniformly but which instead group together in various patterns.The  issues to be addressed also involve the physics of the superconducting materials, those which can conduct electricity with no resistance and thus no waste of energy. The questions are quite basic.  What is it about superconductivity that causes working temperatures, generally, to be so low? Why is there, in some high temperature superconductors, an ''optimal'' composition at which the working temperature is highest? Are there optimal ways of creating structures for superconductivity, structures that enhance performance?

A module on medical technology is added that addresses the Standards for Technological Literacy.  The module uses real-world examples and practicing engineers and technicians to introduce students to engineering design, analysis and decision-making processes.  This project advances knowledge about effective instruction and curriculum design in engineering/technology education in order to achieve public literacy and better preparation for the next generation of engineering and technology professionals, including teachers.  A model is designed, developed and tested that delivers effective teacher professional development to both inservice and preservice teachers to enable the successful implementation of engineering curricula.  Hypothesis-driven research is performed to evaluate the individual and combined impacts of the curricular materials and the teacher professional development framework on classroom instructional practices and student learning, interests and attitudes and to evaluate which curriculum components are most effective in promoting student learning and interest as a function of gender and ethnicity.","Collaborative Research: Project IBORC: Interaction between Building and Occupant Responses during CollapseAbstractThe primary objective of this project is to conduct a multidisciplinary investigation ? at the intersection of structural engineering, social science, and computer science ? of how building occupants respond to signals issued by a building during and immediately after a compromising event that threatens its integrity. Other secondary objectives are to investigate: 1) how the response of victims is modulated by their social conditions at the time of the incident; and 2) the influence of a building?s structural system on building collapse response and occupant survival rates. Computational simulation models will be developed to represent building collapse and Agent Based Models (ABMs) will be used to model human response within the building models. Existing information will be sought in an effort to formulate basic rules that govern human response during times of extreme danger. The developed models will be calibrated and validated by comparisons to well documented events that involved building collapse. The developed models will then be used to clarify how building occupants respond during emergencies through extensive parametric simulations. The models will also be used to investigate how buildings collapse and to identify the means by which to mitigate building failure and its effects. This project will lead to the education of a new generation of researchers skilled in inter-disciplinary research. The project will furthermore contribute to the state-of-the-art in hazards research by developing knowledge that could form the basis of public education and awareness programs to help building occupants, their rescuers and city officials respond appropriately during extreme events.","SES-0817659Rachel L. EinwohnerPurdue UniversityThis study asks: Why does resistance take place in some situations but not others? What conditions facilitated the emergence of collective armed resistance? While current theories of social movement emergence argue that collective action occurs when groups of individuals have opportunity, resources, and a sense of efficacy, this study will make a contribution by examining resistance under conditions of extreme repression, limited resources, and great despair.  This research will study Jewish victims of the Holocaust who are commonly portrayed as passive individuals. Yet well known cases of Jewish resistance such as the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising demonstrate that in at least some places, Jews did rise up against their oppressors. Jewish ghettos in Nazi-occupied Europe therefore provide a useful setting for an empirical study of the emergence of collective resistance under extreme circumstances. This project will make a contribution to the extant literature by examining an understudied context for collective action and use the results to develop new theoretical models. The investigator will conduct in-depth qualitative analysis and compare three strategically selected case studies: the Warsaw Ghetto (where collective Jewish resistance occurred), the Vilna Ghetto (where collective resistance was planned but not achieved), and the Lodz Ghetto (where collective resistance was never attempted). Data will include both primary and secondary sources, including transcripts from a random sample (N=120) of archived oral testimonies from survivors of each ghetto (40 from each ghetto). These testimonies are housed at the University of Southern California Shoah Foundation Institute. Oral testimony data will be analyzed using the qualitative software package NVivo.The study?s broader impacts are both educational and policy-related. First, the project will help contribute to extant knowledge about collective action and contentious politics in general. Although the results are intended primarily for professional academic audiences, they may also be used in other educational settings (e.g., Holocaust education in public schools). In addition, to the extent that they are disseminated more widely (e.g., through the media), the findings can also have an impact on the general public?s understanding of the Holocaust, especially by helping to dispel the myth of Jewish passivity. Lastly, the findings will have relevance to contemporary cases of resistance such as armed insurgencies, prison revolts and urban riots.","In most areas of human knowledge, the information revolution has resulted in a massive data explosion. The scale of data sets, their distributed and heterogeneous nature, and the need to quickly deliver results easily interpretable by non-experts, raise new theoretical and computational challenges for statistical learning, from variable selection and structural inference to visualization and online learning. This project uses sparse statistical inference as a powerful approach to meet these challenges. Its key insight is that seeking sparsity is a meaningful way of simultaneously stabilizing inference procedures, and highlighting structure in the underlying data. This work thus combines fundamental advances in sparse statistical learning with cutting-edge computational tools from mathematical programming to create a new framework for structural knowledge discovery in large-scale, streaming data sets. It is focused on two fundamental themes in sparse inference: variable selection and structural inference. Variable selection seeks to isolate a few key variables from high dimensional data sets and is a fundamental preprocessing tool in statistical learning. Structural inference then aims to consistently identify a few core dependence relationships among these variables to highlight its structure. From a computational point of view, many recent results in machine learning have relied on advanced methods from convex optimization such as semidefinite programming and robust optimization and this project seeks to improve the complexity of these algorithms and their capacity to handle very-large scale, streaming data.  In practice, this project is motivated by the desire to help the public understand our democracies by analyzing large-scale political and social data sets, with a particular focus on voting records, online news sources, and polling data. Its approach is to apply statistical inference principles to social sciences, using collaborations with experts in political science and economics to forge the models and techniques under study. In carrying out the research, this project will be training graduate students from statistics, electrical engineering/financial engineering into interdisciplinary researchers at the interface of statistics, optimization, and subject matter areas such as finance and political science. In addition we plan to develop a web site, accessible first to a restricted set of social science researchers, to allow them to analyze mid-sized corpora of online news in text format, in the form of say, sparse graphs of words showing statistical associations between given keywords. The PIs plan to develop a software toolbox implementing these results, interfaced with common numerical packages such as MATLAB, R or python as well as an undergraduate course on ``Statistical Analysis of Online Data  at Berkeley and Princeton, incorporating some of the material produced in this project into the course program.","Designing a response to global climate change requires analysis tools that can help decision makers understand the tradeoffs between the cost of a policy and its benefit in the form of avoided climate change. Both the costs and the benefits, however, are uncertain. To date, models used in studies of climate change have not represented all the critical uncertainties. One important omission is the representation of uncertainty in returns to research and development (R&amp;D) directed to the improvement of energy technologies. Studies on R&amp;D have shown that such returns are uncertain and highly skewed (i.e., have a small probability of a very large breakthrough). Ignoring this uncertainty and focusing on the average effect will produce biased estimates of the emissions reductions required to meet particular targets or the relative balance between near-term emissions constraints and investments in energy technology R&amp;D.This research will improve the analysis tools available to decision makers by developing a model framework that explicitly represents the uncertainty in the returns to R&amp;D. The representation of technical change and its relation to R&amp;D expenditure will be calibrated to historical experience with U.S. patents. The model will also improve the representation of the uncertainty in the climate response to greenhouse gas emissions by constraining that uncertainty to a range consistent with 20th century climate. These components will be integrated into a single framework that can be used to explore decision making about emissions reductions and R&amp;D expenditures under uncertainty.The results of this research will improve the analysis facilities that are applied to climate change assessment. The new tools are expected to give improved guidance in the timing of emissions reductions and investments in technology R&amp;D by eliminating biases in current models.","CBET-0838607DozierThe WATERS Network is an initiative to transform science and engineering of the water environment.  The goal is to create a national capability to better predict and manage the behavior of water-and its nutrients, contaminants, and sediments-everywhere in the U.S.  Population growth, evolving land use, and climate change make the future water environment uncertain, so prediction and management require understanding along with statistical relationships, and thereby require integration among people who study how water moves and transforms landscapes; who manage and treat water to ensure potable supplies and prevent floods; and who consider how humans, institutions, and managed systems respond to and superimpose variability on quality, scarcity, or hazard. Driving the requirement for an integrated, collaboratively developed infrastructure is the recognition that we have to predict and manage water nationwide.  Predicting Water Quality and Quantity Everywhere at All Times (WQ2EAT) requires a judicious integration of models and syn-thesis, cyberinfrastructure, education and outreach, existing networks, and remotely sensed data, along with new measurements, analyses, and experiments at a realistic number of carefully chosen sites or basins.  A network of observational and experimental facilities, where processes are studied and manipulated, will provide knowledge that can be transferred to any location on the continent.  The proposed network spans the domain of water environments-pristine, rural, and urban areas and constructed networks and facilities for management and treatment.  The capacity for prediction ranges from episodic events such as floods and storm-water overflows, through seasonal spring runoff and surges of agricultural wastes, to multi-decadal projections.The task of the investigation is to create a prototype network design that will enable detailed specification and budgeting to prepare for a conceptual design review.  The investigation will analyze existing sources of data across a domain representing the extant human-influenced water environment, conduct modeling exercises to identify new measurement needs and predict in locations where we lack intensive measurements, and scrutinize emerging technologies and different variables to observe at different scales.  Alternative observational designs, as well as experimental facilities and campaigns, will be evaluated according to their capability to support key scientific objectives. The WATERS Network will help us understand and predict the ways in which heterogeneous processes interact with one another at different scales to produce the variability found in the water environment.  Knowledge about explicitly scale-dependent processes will thereby inform options for management and engineering design. Water for human consumption, agriculture, and industrial processes is perhaps humanitys most fundamental need.  Our traditional methods of predicting and managing water and its quality are based on statistical relations developed when human impacts were isolated and climate was relatively stable.  These boundary conditions are changing, hence the need for new fundamental understanding.  The WATERS Network focuses on the U.S., but the knowledge gained and the technologies developed will apply globally.","IMPACT MECHANICS AND CENTRAL PIT FORMATION ON ICY SATELLITES Central pit craters are an unusual morphological class of impact crater seen most commonly on the large icy satellites Ganymede and Callisto where they replace the peak-ring morphology expected","The earliest detailed records of Australia's indigenous languages date from approximately two hundred years ago, and therefore our only access to the prehistory of Australia's indigenous past is through reconstruction in archeology and linguistics. While we know that humans have lived in Australia for more than 40,000 years, we do not know how speakers of the 250 currently attested languages came to live where they do today. This project uses linguistic evidence to trace the history of Aboriginal people in prehistoric times. Systematic similarities between words in these languages can be used to reconstruct various properties of prehistoric languages. These techniques will be used to determine the structure of the Pama-Nyungan language family, which will shed light on prehistoric population movements.Australia's linguistic prehistory is important for several reasons. It has been claimed that methods developed for Europe and the Americas do not work in Australia. If true, such a finding would be highly important, since these methods are based on properties of language change which until now have been assumed to be universal. However, preliminary work indicates that Australian languages show the same characteristics that we find elsewhere. Small speech community size, widespread multilingualism, and other factors have obscured relationships between these languages. These languages are an excellent laboratory for modeling what language change might have been like before the spread of agricultural communities. If we are ever going to be able to model accurately what prehistoric global language spread might have looked like, we need to understand how it operated in Australia.","IMPROVED NUMERICAL MODELING OF GAS-SURFACE INTERACTION IN HYPERSONIC FLOWS  A modification to the NASA DPLR code is proposed to improve the capability of the tool to simulate detailed gas/surface interaction chemistry on TPS materials for applications to","The Kentucky (KY) EPSCoR RII-7 proposal unites eight institutions, University of Kentucky, Berea College, Centre College of Kentucky, Kentucky State University, Morehead State University, Northern Kentucky University, University of Louisville, and Eastern Kentucky University, to continue the strategy of investing in infrastructure to develop Kentucky?s ?New Economy? by supporting research in Innovative Materials and Devices.  Intellectual Merit This project will pursue two major research initiatives. Initiative in Innovative Materials and Devices is focused on studies of bulk single-crystal transition metal oxides and epitaxial thin films with complementary functionalities, and applications of multilayered thin films for molecular electrodes as well as for single-molecule magnets. The other part of the project will focus on engineering new platforms to enhance our understanding of a single cell or multiple cell types, interactions between individual cells and cell types, and sensing at the molecular, intracellular and intercellular levels. A statewide Micro/Nano Network will advance micro/nanotechnology and the many fields that utilize this technology.Broader ImpactsKentucky EPSCoR has developed a comprehensive plan for increasing diversity and evaluating progress in that area.  Programs such as seed-funding that supports research at regional institutions and a program to involve diverse populations of Kentucky students in research will be supported through EPSCoR.  A special program for computer science graduate students at Kentucky State University will be introduced.  Kentucky EPSCoR also proposes the cyberinfrastructure plans for the state, and augments them with support for increasing the expertise and developing new sources of talent. The project is consistent with the state?s science and technology plan, and the associated higher education plan.  The project will develop new facilities and establish new faculty and staff positions in the bio-, nano-, &amp; cyber-technology areas.  Kentucky EPSCoR has developed a review process intended to identify infrastructure that should support the most promising research.  A system of evaluation metrics has been developed to determine whether a strategy is working, and if it is improving Kentucky?s competitiveness.","The investigators propose to develop and test new instructional techniques aimed at teaching high-school science students how to use the diagrams that appear in their biology textbooks. Research from a range of disciplines has shown that people have difficulty making sense of diagrams. The investigators had previously found that inference and other high-level processes that are important for learning from text are even more important for learning from diagrams. They further showed that students show little gains in content understanding from textbook diagrams. The investigators will capitalize on commonalities among several theories of diagrammatic reasoning to develop four interventions, following an additive design, aimed at improving classroom instruction in how to use diagrams. In each iteration, one additional intervention feature is added to the initial intervention. In the first intervention, they will teach the components of diagrams (i.e., how to read captions, color keys, and other conventions of diagrams). In the second, they will also teach the coordinating of text and diagrams. In the third, they will also have the students engage in self-explanation. In the fourth, they will also have students construct their own drawings. In conjunction with these experimental studies, the investigators will collect eye tracking data on a subset of participants pre- and post-intervention in order to look for possible changes in gaze patterns.","The Center for the Study of Black Youth in Context (CSBYC) will focus on research and action on social, psychological, and educational development among African American children and youth.  The CSBYC has four major objectives: (1) to develop an infrastructure for a series of coordinated research investigations of the ecological, cultural, racial, and familial contexts that influence the development of African American children; (2) to provide training for early scholars, graduate students, and undergraduate students around skills necessary to do research and practice with diverse populations of ethnic minority children in diverse community and school settings; (3) to cultivate collaborative relationships and partnerships between the University of Michigan and local communities to inform current and prospective practice and  intervention approaches for improving youth social and educational outcomes; (4) to serve as a resource and clearinghouse for scholarship, training, and practice approaches that can be utilized by scholarly and community stakeholders in the state more broadly, as well as among institutional and community settings nationally.  To meet these goals, CSBYC investigators will conduct an initial research study of middle school aged children in four diverse community settings. The goals of the research project are to study ways parents and family caregivers socialize their children around race and to examine the influence of various types of parenting on child academic and social outcomes. Using multiple methods (surveys, family diary studies, qualitative interviews, and observations), the research will show how parents choose parenting strategies based on characteristics of their communities (e.g., racial and economic diversity) along with their appraisals of the racial, cultural, and class dynamics of their communities. The CSBYC research will contribute to understanding of normative development of African American children within their varying family, neighborhood, and school contexts, which has received relatively little systematic attention. The study of Black youth from different social class backgrounds is important for a number of reasons.  First, despite the growing Black middle class in America, a disproportionate number of studies have focused only on low-income Black children in urban settings and/or on high-risk youth populations. Consequently, race and social class often are confounded in research and in its application to practices/interventions to enhance youth development.  There is less knowledge of family, educational, and social development processes of African American children across different social class groups and the implications of community social class and demographic diversity, such as Black families' movement to, and increasing representation in, middle class or suburban settings. For instance, studies show that parental education is one of the biggest predictors of school achievement among African American youth, yet even middle class African American students trail their European American counterparts in academic achievement. Such patterns suggest that parents of different social class backgrounds differentially negotiate the schooling process for their children. It also suggests there still is much to be learned about variation in family processes within lower and higher socioeconomic levels. By examining Black families from diverse community contexts, the CSBYC investigators will address important questions about the nature of development among Black youth in ways that can support the efforts of researchers, communities, schools, and families to encourage successful development among children and adolescents.","Government policy today targets firms rather than firm ecosystems.  Given the increased fragmentation of firm activities and increased technological interdependency of these firms over the past 20 years, this mode of policy-making may be outdated.  This research leverages a natural experiment in the converging telecommunications and computing industry to examine the impact on the innovation ecosystem of removing a critical set of innovating firms. Drawing on the results, the researchers seek to define characteristics of innovation ecosystems that could provide resiliency against future shocks.Despite extensive study, there is little agreement within the academic, industrial, or policy communities on the impact of moving firm activities offshore on innovation back in the U.S.  Previous work by the P.I. has shown that moving manufacturing offshore changes technology development incentives.  Specifically, her results show that when U.S. firms shift production from the U.S. to developing East Asia, the most advanced technologies that were developed in the U.S. no longer pay.  Production characteristics are different abroad, and earlier technologies can be more cost-effective in developing country environment.  Building on these results, this project seeks to understand the impact of manufacturing offshore on (1) the innovative activities of the firms that moved manufacturing offshore, and (2) the continued advance of the advanced technologies within the same or other institutions in the U.S. In the case of the first part of the study, the results demonstrate whether firms which relocated manufacturing offshore are following a different technology trajectory from those firms still manufacturing in the U.S.  In the case of the second part of the study, the results shed insight into whether the relocation of manufacturing offshore has, in the case of the ecosystem of study, shifted the institutional locus of innovation. Broader Impact: In recent years, there has been rising concern over the ability of the U.S. to remain competitive in the global economy. Understanding how innovation ecosystems react to a set of innovating firms moving activities offshore is critical to redefining U.S. science and innovation policy and to improving the resiliency of such systems. The results of this study shed insights into the significance of institutional location -- small versus large firms, universities, or government labs -- on the quantity and direction of innovation.  Leveraging these results, the project characterizes critical metrics of innovation ecosystems that may aid in their resiliency against shocks such as a large set of innovating firms moving manufacturing offshore.  Metrics may include such units as coupling intensity between manufacturing location and innovative output, institutional fluidity, firm-university patent-publication interdependency, and other metrics that emerge from the result of the study.  These metrics can be used immediately by policy-makers to assess ecosystem resiliency, and will enable academics to build on them in future work characterizing industry ecosystems. Finally, the particular technology of study -- optoelectronics -- is critical to advance in communications, computing, and sensing.  Understanding the policy levers to continue technology development in optoelectronics may be essential to U.S. economic and military leadership.","SES-0818337Meredith Kleykamp   University of KansasThe project will measure whether employers exhibit discriminatory or preferential attitudes toward military veterans and whether this affects veteran treatment in the hiring process. This study explores how and why veteran outcomes differ by race/ethnicity and gender. The main goals of the project are to: 1) identify how military veterans fare in hiring, document the extent of differential hiring treatment of veterans and whether such treatment varies by race and gender using an experimental design 2) explore the mechanisms explaining employer  treatment of veterans, how employers evaluate military experience, and what meaning military experience holds in the civilian hiring process using in-depth interviews with hiring agents and 3) adjudicate competing sociological explanations for differential veteran/nonveteran employment outcomes, of human capital development, selection, signaling or screening, and cultural capital development on the basis of the audit and interview data.  Broader ImpactsThe research has broad reaching social impacts.  First, it contributes to both the academic and practical understanding of veteran hiring practices. Findings will foster development of veteran-friendly transition and employment policies.  Evidence of discriminatory hiring practices or negative sentiments toward military job seekers would suggest the need for better employer education on laws protecting military members and better evaluation of compliance with such laws.  On the other hand, evidence of preferential treatment could clarify that employment transition difficulties facing veterans lie elsewhere in the hiring or job matching process.   The project contributes to the recent University of Kansas-Ft. Leavenworth initiative facilitating collaboration between the University and the Army?s Command and General Staff College by providing information that can be used to aid military policymaking.","X-Ray Flares: The Last Breath of the Inner Engine Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB) explosions occur approximately three times per day in the visible universe (not considering the beaming correction) and have been observed routinely by highly successful dedicated mis","DETERMINATION OF THE BONE MARROW MACROPHAGE PHENOTYPE IN SPACE Summary:  THE EXPERIMENTS PROPOSED BY THE PI FOR THE ULF2 MISSION DEFINITELY IS ALIGNED WITH NASA'S MISSION.

These  learning curves  have been observed in many team settings, including software development teams, hospital surgery teams and coal-mining crews.  This research project will examine constituents of team experience in order to learn more about the specific phenomena that underlie learning curve gains. Researchers have attributed some of the performance gains associated with team longevity to the development of  transactive memory  (TM) systems, which involve awareness of who knows and does what on a team. When a team has a well-defined TMS, team members know whom to rely on for specific skills or expertise. A series of laboratory studies will manipulate the match between team members' knowledge and roles and the extent to which team members share a common language. The experiments will examine the separate and interactive effects of these variables on team performance as well as the nature of the task (e.g., its uncertainty, urgency), characteristics of team members (e.g., member diversity), and features of the work context (e.g., whether team performance occurs in a virtual or co-located setting) in order to identify which component of transactive memory (or which interactions) increases team performance.  This research has theoretical and practical implications. Due to the rapid organizational and technological changes prevalent in today's workplace, teams often do not not have the luxury of staying together for extended periods.  By unpacking the constituents of learning curve effects we learn how to promote these effects more quickly. Conversely, we can learn to recognize the conditions in which there can be no substitute for time.","The project proposes a conference to stimulate a national conversation on new STEM learning research paradigms that cut across boundaries and investigate multiple contexts and media, rather than historical approaches that have viewed learning within limited temporal, spatial and socio-cultural contexts.The project will create a special peer-reviewed, international themed issue in the journal Science Education that reflects the meeting, convene the national conference of prominent learning sciences researchers, host a post-conference national web conference, follow-up on participants after one year, and host a series of national discussions around new paradigms in STEM at multiple national meetings.","Despite evidence that innovation has become increasingly collaborative, our understanding of collaborative creativity and its impact on economic productivity remains incomplete.  For example, how should firms structure the collaborations of their inventors, given that networks which enhance the generation of a new idea also appear to hamper the dissemination of that idea?  How does knowledge flow within and between regions and how can policy makers influence those flows for maximal social welfare?  How does investment in scientific research result in peer-reviewed publication, the diffusion of knowledge, invention, and patenting, and ultimate gains in economic productivity?  These questions remain unanswered because social network data are difficult to gather, particularly across time, space, and boundaries.  This proposal allows answering these questions by calculating and posting millions of relational data, based on all co-authorship ties between inventors of U.S. patents, from 1963 through the present.The database complements the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) patent database by providing the social networks of patent co-authorships.  It creates a standard social network patent database at the individual inventor and aggregate levels including organizational, regional, and technological.  It reduces barriers to entry to scholars who lack the requisite programming skills and hardware to create the data on their own and enables real time graphing of patent co-authorship networks.  It provides a website by which actual inventors can assess the accuracy of the algorithms used to uniquely identify them in the patent database.  Finally, the project provides data on a public website accessible by scholars, business analysts, and students.  Just as the original NBER database has unleashed broad and diverse scholarship on innovation (over 500 papers cite it, according to Google Scholar, by early 2008), the social network database project will unleash a similar wave of research, focused on collaborative creativity and the social networks of inventors and their organizations.Broader Impacts: The research will publish social network data from all U.S. patent co-authorships (1963-present) for use by researchers, students, and business analysts.  It will provide real-time ability to visually illustrate these networks, with a variety of variables illustrated by color and size of the nodes and co-authorship links.  It will enable answering how managers should structure collaborative relationships and how information flows across organizational, regional, and technological boundaries.  It will enable tracing the career productivity and mobility of millions of inventors around the world.  In conjunction with other databases on research grants and scientific publication, it will illuminate the process of knowledge creation and dissemination at many levels of analysis, from the individual, to the organizational, and international.The primary purpose of this project is to make social network data, based on the co-authorship of U.S. patents from 1963 through the present, available to researchers and the public at large.  The plan, within six months of project start, is to make the data available from the Harvard MIT Data Center.  The data will also be archived in the Henry A. Murray Research Archive.  Raw data and the source code will be included in these postings.","ENERGY MANAGEMENT IN SERIAL MANIPULATORS VIA SERIES ELASTIC ACTUATION SUBSYSTEMS The goal is to improve robot arm performance over a broad range of tasks that might include both intentional impacts (employing hammers / picks / chisels / etc.) and mitigati","MOLECULAR BASIS OF DNA REPAIR AND PROTECTION FROM APOPTOSIS IN NEURONAL PROGENITORS EXPOSED TO SPACE RADIATION The health risks to astronauts exposed to space radiation include cognitive deficits and possibly accelerated aging.

It is usually impossible to conduct a true experiment with random assignment of students to educational opportunities.  However, large-scale shifts in policy can serve as  natural experiments  that change the way students are matched to educational programs and allow us to identify causal consequences of education.The specific research question addressed by this project is:  Do institution-level shifts in the number of science and engineering degrees conferred lead to measurable changes in graduate outcomes?for example: higher earnings, increased participation in the science and engineering workforce, or a larger probability of filing patents?relative to similar earlier graduates? And how does the research inform the science of science policy?Writing in 1994, William Trent and John Hill described a concerted effort by a group of Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) to expand educational opportunities in engineering, computer science and other technical fields,  to prepare their students for expanded career choices.   Preliminary evidence suggests that a shift in the relative participation of black college graduates in occupations related to engineering, math, computer science, or physical sciences (EMS) occurred at about the same time.  Furthermore, growth in EMS college majors was particularly strong among students most likely to attend HBCUs:  those who attended high school in the South.  The initial phase of this project is designed to distinguish whether the growth was driven by HBCU policies, or by change at other southern institutions.  The second phase involves assembling more than 30 years of data on the number and type of degrees conferred by each U.S. institution of higher education (collected annually by the U.S. Department of Education), analyzing the data to find other examples of large institution-level (or state-level) shifts in the number of science and engineering degrees conferred, and combining this information with data from other sources to discover the resulting educational and economic impacts.The initial phase of this research is designed to reveal the institution-level processes underlying recent expansion of science and engineering participation by a persistently underrepresented minority group.  More generally, the research project expands knowledge about the extent to which exposure to science or engineering education at the undergraduate level changes the set of skills college graduates bring to the labor market, and whether that change is substantial enough to affect a whole host of outcome measures including earnings, occupation, and patent activity. Broader ImpactsThe knowledge gained from this research project informs individual-level career-path choices as well as educational and workforce policies.  Educational materials appropriate for middle school or high school students are intended teach fundamental mathematics concepts while they convey motivating information-- derived from this research-- about the economic value of pursuing academically challenging educational programs.","LAB-ON-A-CHIP APPLICATIONS OF PERMANENT NONWETTING The proposed research seeks to apply knowledge gained through previous NASA support to a problem of current interest-so-called  lab-on-a-chip  (hereafter abbreviated LOC) or  biochip  processing (Bousse -","ASSESSING THE POTENTIAL FOR LIFE ON AN ASTEROID:  THE NATURAL AND ENGINEERED LIMITS OF ORGANISMS AT EXTREME COLD TEMPERATURES AND EXTREME HIGH RADIATION Asteroids are playing an increasingly significant role in the space program.

The assessments are in the areas of (1) number and operations, (2) pre-algebra and algebra, and (3) geometry and measurement and are based in the literature on student's cognitive growth in these mathematical domains.  The instruments are aligned with the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics' Focal Points and with existing  mathematics knowledge for teaching  (MKT) classroom observation instruments.  These assessments differ from existing assessments in that the questions require more complex responses than typical multiple-choice problems.  Yet, they are still machine-scoreable so they can easily be used in studies with large student samples.  Additionally, these assessment instruments enable researchers to capture student growth nested within classrooms, which provides a tool that is able to identify teacher effects on learning.  By comparing students of teachers without MSP  treatment  to students of teachers with MSP treatment in a quasi-experimental design, this research project examines the effects of teacher mathematical knowledge for teaching (MKT) growth on classroom instruction and student achievement.  The project expects to find that high teacher scores on the Learning Mathematics for Teaching (LMT) measures are correlated with the size of student gains on the new assessment instruments.  Additionally, this project adds to the suite of instruments available from the LMT for exploring the connection between teacher learning, teachers' MKT, their classroom instruction, and student outcomes.","This project examines the information seeking and using behaviors of decision makers who face decisions about their future R&amp;D investments.   A number of trends have made these decisions more uncertain, notably  Open Innovation,  the globalization of science and technology, increasingly diverse sources of technical and scientific information, as well as the global outsourcing of research to developing economies.  There is substantial evidence that industrial decision makers lack needed information; are unaware of available information; or need a more inclusive model of appropriate decision processes.  The study sheds light on whether and why industry decision makers choose global R&amp;D over U.S. R&amp;D.  It does this by examining how firms that are global innovators use information about scientific and technical resources, together with other innovation-related data, to shape their investment decisions and competitive strategies.  The project is based on collaboration with the Center for Innovation Management Studies and the Industrial Research Institute (IRI), whose 250 members collectively fund and conduct about 75% of U.S. industrial research. These firms' day-to-day R&amp;D investment decisions are transforming traditional company-owned R&amp;D laboratories into the  Laboratory of the Future  (LOF). Each firm's own  LOF  may consist of a traditional laboratory, a collaborative laboratory, a virtual laboratory or a network of external resources, including university researchers in the U.S. or abroad, as well as government or private labs, collaborative strategic partners, or simulation tools thus augmenting or even replacing company owned physical labs. LOFs are highly likely to vary by industry and by the competitive environment of the firm. The study examines participants' discussions of these decisions and the information resources they use to decide how to build their future innovation capabilities. The project analyzes the LOF discussion to reveal how R&amp;D managers think long-term and strategically about what they do.  The project documents information seeking and information using behavior as exhibited in an on-line discussion by the decision makers about the R&amp;D  LOF . In addition the research opens a window into decision makers' rationales for their investment commitments.Broader Impacts: Corporate R&amp;D executives are making decisions now that will, in the aggregate, shape the LOF and affect U.S. national innovation system. This project documents how they are making those decisions, what information they are presently using, and what kinds of data might be desirable for robust decisions. The project results inform both decision makers in industry and policy makers about data and information sources presently used, not used, and data not presently available but desirable for the future.","Sex is determined by genetic constitution (GSD) in most animals, such as by the sex chromosome pairs XX or XY in humans, or ZZ or ZW in birds.  In certain other animals, however, sex is determined by environmental temperature (TSD).   Among turtle species, however, examples of both types of sex determination can be found.  It remains unclear, however, how and why different sex determining mechanisms exist. This collaborative project will help fill this gap by comparing the chromosomes and sex-related genes of turtles using XX/XY, ZZ/ZW, or TSD mechanisms for sex determination.   Particularly, this research will test whether (1) all sex chromosomes in turtles derive from a common ancestral pair of non-sex chromosomes (or  autosomes ), and whether (2) the molecular evolution of genes located on turtle sex chromosomes differs from that of the same genes in TSD turtles, in which there are no sex chromosomes- i.e., whether the sequences of genes located on sex chromosomes change differently over evolutionary time than do the sequences of the same genes when they are located on autosomes.  This project will integrate undergraduate discovery-based learning for undergraduates into the field and lab modules of this project and will broaden the participation of underrepresented groups in biology by providing direct training opportunities for students and their mentors, by engaging women and minorities through outreach activities, and by providing further opportunities for both the investigators to serve as role models for minorities.","This project addresses a crucial area in the globalization of science: the transmission of skills to future scientists. It does this by examining doctoral training practices critical to the transmission of skills acquired through close interaction and hands-on experience, also known as 'tacit skills.' Although an under researched area in scientific training, 'tacit skills' play a crucial role in the creativity and innovation in experimental and mathematical sciences, laser and nuclear technology development. While there is a standard set of accepted scientific principles shared by most scientists, there are also differences in terms of what is learned and how it is taught. This project focuses on Japan, Singapore and Taiwan. Each of these countries has consistently exhibited high rates of innovation and productivity in recent years. However, while these countries have been successful in science education, each of them approaches the task of training scientists in various methods. The core hypothesis of the study is that student-mentor relationships significantly configure levels of scientific creativity, pioneering discoveries, technical innovation, and research productivity. The project?s main goal is to develop an empirically tested and contemporary model of science that will inform science and innovation policy about the role of 'tacit skills' in knowledge production, and to enhance best practices in U.S. graduate science training. The project analyzes the different methods using analytical, conceptual, and methodological tools from the areas of knowledge sharing, social networks, and the extended translation model of science. While a component of the project will uncover the degree of codified knowledge that is taught by most standard text books and the mastery of this knowledge, the project also seeks to understand advanced knowledge acquisition and transmission through the study of graduate science training by exploring students? relationships with mentors and peers. Contemporary research has shown that the nature of informal educational practices is not only conducive to the acquisition of 'tacit skills' but enhances professional competencies. BROADER IMPACTS: This project not only advances understanding of how 'tacit skills' are transmitted, but also informs pedagogical programs, and generates 'best practices' in advanced scientific training that recognize the changing nature and morphology of knowledge production brought about by globalization. It enhances scientific manpower and infrastructure by establishing networks of collaborations across disciplinary boundaries among scientific institutions globally. This project involves the active participation of students from underrepresented Hispanic populations located along the U.S.-Mexico border. This participation exposes and socializes these students to actual multicultural research work and to professional scientific careers critical to socioeconomic development of the U.S. southern border.","DRL- 0823670PI: Elisa Giaccardi ABSTRACTIn this Communicating Research to Public Audiences project, the University of Colorado at Boulder, in partnership with the University of Colorado Museum of Natural History, the City of Boulder Open Space and Mountain Parks, the CU- Boulder Office of Diversity, Equity and Community Engagement, is building on the work they have done via their NSF research award, A Meta-Design Framework for Participative Software Systems, in which they have been developing participative software systems (PPS) and applications of the software.  Community of Soundscapes will employ newly developed mobile computing and collaborative mapping technology in programs that help users gain greater insights and stake into the shared environment in which they live and visit.  Sound Camera, a digital recording device outfitted with GPS mapping software, allows users to collect audio clips of their sonic experiences as they explore their cities, parks and other environments and upload them online onto a digital map through a Web 2.0 application.  They can then compose, annotate, and share soundscapes of the places where the sounds were recorded.  A Web site will be developed to expand the project?s reach to audiences not in the Boulder programs.  Professional development training will be provided for collaborators and through the Colorado Alliance for Environmental Education.  The educational goals are to promote literacy of PSS and engage the public in personally meaningful activities that benefit environmental education (cognitive goal) and expand environmental awareness (affective goal).  The project work and its evaluation processes (by Wells Resources, Inc.) are intended to advance the field of informal science education with respect to PSS and to study how these new technologies might affect shifts in the kinds of experiences various audiences prefer to have.","Sex is determined by genetic constitution (GSD) in most animals, such as by the sex chromosome pairs XX or XY in humans, or ZZ or ZW in birds.

This project will integrate undergraduate discovery-based learning for undergraduates into the field and lab modules of this project and will broaden the participation of underrepresented groups in biology by providing direct training opportunities for students and their mentors, by engaging women and minorities through outreach activities, and by providing further opportunities for both the investigators to serve as role models for minorities.","PHASE II: NASA TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER AND INNOVATIVE PARTNERSHIP PROGRAM The National Technology Transfer Center (NTTC) promotes technology infusion by creating awareness of technologies and areas of expertise developed in the NASA SBlR/STTR Program - and el","NASA URC SPACE CENTER CONTINUATION CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY - LOS ANGELES This proposal requests funds to continue the investigation and development of key technologies related to critical NASA missions and programs.

The investigators are targeting to devise means of employing instead lignocellulosic biomaterials (biocarbons) that originate naturally from within America.  The team will build on their recently-devised means of functionalizing the porous biocarbons with reduced-nitrogen groups that remove perchlorate and other oxyanions.  The project will link into the Sloan Fellowship program for Minority Ph.D. candidates at Penn State, which is co-led by PI Dr. Cannon.  There will also be participation in Penn State's CURO program, which facilitates minority undergraduate research.","0754379MunnThe International Research Fellowship Program enables U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct nine to twenty-four months of research abroad.  The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions abroad.This award will support a twenty-four month research fellowship by Dr. Michael R. Munn to work with Dr. Peter M. Topping at Mathematics Institute at the University of Warwick in the UK.The aim of this project is to work closely with Dr. Peter Topping and the Geometric Analysis group of the Mathematics Institute at the University of Warwick. First, the PI aims to continue his research studying the influence of volume growth on the topology of Riemannian manifolds with nonnegative Ricci curvature. Second, the PI aims to study the consequences of a lower bound on Ricci curvature in the more general setting of metric measure spaces. This concept is on the forefront of research in geometric analysis and has only recently been developed. As such there are many fundamental open questions. Lastly, the PI aims to study the behavior of Ricci flow in this more general setting and determine any topological or geometric consequences for the underlying metric space. Recently, Fields Medalist Perelman has used Hamilton?s Ricci flow to solve the century old Poincare conjecture. These fields are being actively pursued by researchers within the Mathematics Institute at Warwick, most notably by Dr. Topping, thus making Warwick an ideal place for this fellowship research. Dr. Topping is a leading expert in geometric analysis and has employed the techniques of geometric flows, such as Ricci flow and mean curvature flow, with great success. Dr. Topping is one of only a few mathematicians studying e nature of Ricci flow on metric measure spaces.  An understanding of Ricci curvature and Ricci flow in metric spaces is of great importance in geometric analysis and metric geometry. These original concepts have only recently been introduced and are on the forefront of research in geometric analysis. In Perelman?s work, he did not address the Ricci flow when singularities develop and this has been an important question of Hamilton, Lott, and others. In a very recent paper, Topping and McCann introduce a notion of Ricci flow for metric spaces. These advances are of great importance as they can be used to understand the development of these singularities. The PI?s current research involves prior work of Perelman?s involving Ricci curvature. The PI also extends these results to metric measure spaces. The Mathematics Institute at Warwick is a thriving environment and is undergoing rapid expansion. The large number of resources available within the Institute make this an ideal host site.  Currently there is great interest in the development of these new ideas for Ricci flow in metric spaces and these techniques have applications across the physical sciences. The ideas related to Ricci flow are closely related to those of mean curvature flow as well as crystal flow. Understanding the development of singularities in this context is essential. In particular, singularities describe the development of flaws in crystals. A deeper understanding of the implications of this research will enable the PI to be a better professor at a university with science majors and engineers.","Adaptation to the impacts of climatic change is now at the forefront of scientific inquiry and policy negotiations, but the current debate has contributed little to the understanding of the decision-making processes that shape adaptation and resilient livelihoods.  This interdisciplinary research project hypothesizes that cyclical (loop) learning enhances people's anticipatory capacity, which is reflected in more flexible and dynamic local and regional adaptation plans.  The investigators propose a resilience-enhancing approach that emphasizes an iterative way of analyzing and learning about changes and uncertainties in the past, present, and future.  By focusing explicitly on learning processes and decision-support tools, this project is expected to reverse the deterministic notion of presumably vulnerable groups as passive victims of climate change by highlighting people's skills, knowledge, strategic responses, anticipatory capacity, and agency for adaptation planning.  Research will be conducted in selected rural communities in Ghana and Tanzania using methods from the learning sciences, rural sociology, cultural geography, and participatory action research to understand how anticipatory learning (learning that helps people anticipate and adapt to change) occurs on the ground and how it can be enhanced.The contributions of this project are expected to be threefold:  (1) a theory regarding how anticipatory learning works in the context of climate change; (2) initial measures of people's individual and collective capacity for anticipation; and (3) pilot interventions for anticipatory learning tools.  The project will address new and important questions in decision theory with respect to processes that permit some communities to better adapt to change than others; relationships among social configuration, learning practices, and decision making under climatic risk; and dynamics in knowledge creation and action.  The project also will provide immediate benefits for the study populations, training opportunities in the U.S. and in Africa, and findings that have high potential impact on the pressing human impacts of climate change.  Through co-design of adaptation tools and interventions in Ghana and Tanzania, the research will foster people's capacity to influence their future through iterative planning rather than learning by shock.  The study will involve students in the U.S. in three ways:  (1) graduate and undergraduate students educated and trained through their direct participation in the conduct of this project; (2) undergraduate students enrolled in a course on climate change adaptation and study abroad in Africa; and (3) an interdisciplinary graduate seminar to design anticipatory learning tools with African colleagues.  The U.S. investigators will work closely with researchers and practitioners at African partner institutions (the University of Dar-es-Salaam in Tanzania, the University of Ghana, and the Afram Plains Development Organization (APDO) as well as with disaster risk and development organizations (CARE International and the Red Cross/Red Crescent).  An award resulting from the FY 2008 NSF-wide competition on Human and Social Dynamics (HSD) supports this project.  All NSF directorates and offices are involved in the coordinated management of the HSD competition and the portfolio of HSD awards.","Abstract For nearly a century, biologists have debated whether past climate change promoted speciation in temperate zone organisms. Models of climate-driven geographic speciation were developed for many groups of temperate organisms, and a particularly detailed and explicit speciation model was developed for North American birds. Over the last decade, this paradigm for North American birds has become the topic of debate, and so a comprehensive understanding of how temperate zone birds were impacted by past environmental change events remains elusive. This project will directly test the paradigm and will significantly extend understanding of the history of the fauna of pine and oak woodlands. The work will use state-of-the-art molecular techniques and analyses to examine the temporal and spatial patterns of diversification of North American birds in relation to past environmental change and will produce a multi-locus comparative phylogeography of pine and oak woodland birds. The project provides significant mentoring and research opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students, including many students from underrepresented groups, and gives these students a unique opportunity to work in a multi-institutional and multidisciplinary research effort between a small rural university and two large urban research universities. The project also will support a workshop for high school teachers from the rural and reservation communities of western South Dakota and provide them the knowledge and resources to teach about climate change and its impact on biotic diversity in their classrooms.","Proposal Title: SGER: Collaborative Research: Exploration of Distributed Creativityin Multi-Site 3D Tele-Immersive SpacesInstitution: University of California-BerkeleyAbstract Date: 07/29/08This project explores the impact of geographically distributed 3D tele-immersiveenvironments on dancers' creativity and their perception of themselves and each other.More specifically, the project will study the impact of digital options, such as scale andmultiply, on the dancers' creative expression and improvisation. A formal notation,called a creativity graph, will be derived from a Laban movement analysis of thedancers' movement. A dancer develops a creative dance, a new sequence of phrases,when he/she generates a new association between two movement states (e.g. a newassociation between two Laban positions) based on some feedback from the immersiveenvironment due to either invoking digital options or due to some unexpectedperformance of the system. This project will have a fundamental impact on ourunderstanding of dancers' creativity within tele-immersive dancing environments andcomputing and will contribute a new concept of transformational movement graphs as acomputational representation of dance creativity in distributed multi-site 3Dtele-immersive spaces.","For the vast majority of human history, people all over the world have lived in small social groups as hunters and gatherers, and not in towns or villages. Agriculture has been claimed to be the driving force for recent population expansions: in the strongest claims, almost all current language families ultimately have their pre-industrial distribution because of agricultural expansion. While the spread of farming and languages associated with it has claimed a lot of recent attention, there has been very little corresponding work on the languages of hunter-gatherers. It is important for our overall understanding of social dynamics to analyze what drives change and spread among hunter-gatherers and determine whether such processes are different from what occurred after the farming revolution, 10,000 years ago. Researchers from the US, Canada, New Zealand and Australia will collaborate on work comparing hunter-gatherer groups on three continents (North America, South America, and Australia). In North and South America, some hunter-gatherer languages have spread over large distances, but farming and associated languages have also spread widely, and in some cases farmers reverted to foraging. In Australia, the transition to farming never took place but one language family spread very widely. Results from genetics, linguistics, anthropology and archaeology will be combined to clarify what the relative contributions of migration and language shift were to language spreads. Among the linguistic data to be collected are vocabulary in the fields of plants and animals, and kinship and social organization.","Optical flow switching has recently emerged as a promising new approach to address the exponentially growing traffic demands in optical networks. In order to realize this new paradigm for optical networks, the core network must be capable of wavelength reconfiguration and service provisioning on time scales approaching one second or faster. The present methods used in wavelength division multiplexed (WDM) optical transmission are designed for static wavelength channels, which can increase in number over time and may be configurable to form different paths at the time of provisioning. Provisioning new wavelengths is a methodical, one at a time, step-wise process of ?turning up? the optical signal along the path, which requires minutes to hours in order to achieve the final stable state, appropriate for GMPLS networks. Furthermore, the extensive literature on optical transmission assumes this quasi-static network environment. The intellectual merit of this project will be to determine both the practical and fundamental limitations on optical flow switched networks imposed by physical layer constraints, including optical transmission in a dynamic, wavelength switching environment. This goal is particularly challenging because of the multi-layer nature of the problem. The network topology and signaling protocols will dictate physical layer transmission requirements, such as how fast the optical signal must achieve an error free condition and over what transmission distance. Likewise the physical limitations both in terms of performance and cost will motivate design choices for the architectures and protocols. In order to address the multi-layer nature of optical flow switched networks, this GOALI project is proposed as a mechanism to utilize the novel optically transparent mesh network testbed facility within Bell Laboratories to extend the network architecture activities within the NSF funded NeTS-FIND Future Optical Network Architectures program at MIT. In particular, targeted experiments will be conducted in the testbed in conjunction with the optical flow switched network optimization studies at MIT. This new testbed has recently been used to study both the power dynamics and the transmission performance of signals in reconfigurable optical networks. These two elements are essential for understanding the physical layer in a transparent switched network and this facility is unique in that it combines these in a broadband, long haul transmission configuration, typical of core networks. This university-industry collaboration will have broader impact at many levels. The problem of scaling optical networks to serve the dramatic rise in internet traffic has broad social ramifications. The project will enable cooperation between two synergistic research efforts to address this important problem: at MIT and at Bell Labs. The academic participants will have the opportunity to work in a premier industrial research laboratory and benefit from the knowledge and skills specific to that environment. In the process, the program will provide a unique opportunity to merge the traditions within both organizations of promoting individual driven","A GLOBAL VIEW OF THE ASTEROID BELT WITH THE SPITZER ASTEROID CATALOG SUMMARY: Natural philosophers Immanuel Kant (in 1755) and Pierre-Simon Laplace (in 1796) suggested that the planets of the Solar System formed from a flat disk surrounding the Sun.

The prototype will be piloted to families and caretakers of deaf and hard of hearing children to study the feasibility and effectiveness of the learning technology and identify the activities that are most effective in helping deaf children learn life science at informal science centers. The project team will also compile a dictionary of science terms with the intention of including the terms in a full version of the Pictionary. The final Pictionary will be comprehensive; including scientific terms from life, physical, Earth, and space science and will be presented in animated sign language accompanied by written explanations and pictorial illustrations. The project will also produce a video guide with a description of activities that parents can implement with their children. The planning project will result in a prototype with 100 life science terms of species found at the three informal science centers the children and parents will visit to test the prototype. These informal sites are hands-on and exploratory featuring marine organisms and a range of terrestrial flora and fauna to touch and interact with. To prepare for the site visits, parents and caretakers of deaf or hard of hearing children will be taught how to use the Pictionary with children through a Flash-based movie that introduces the interactive features and assists the parents in engaging with their children in three activities using the signing scientific vocabulary. The preparatory vocabulary work with the parents and children will lay the educational foundation for the visits to the informal science education sites. Families will test the initial project prototypes with deaf children using a control group for comparison. Pre-tests will be used to assess childrens' vocabulary before use of the Pictionary. Follow up tests will test knowledge of the new words and will include field observations of children in museums, zoos, and farms, where the new terms will come to life in corresponding exhibits. The results of the ongoing evaluation will be compiled into a guide for other developers of similar materials for the deaf community, and will impact the development of the final project. The project will broaden participation of an underserved audience in STEM learning and generate new knowledge about how to effectively integrate emerging learning technologies into exhibits and programs for deaf learners.The project team includes TERC and Vcom3D and collaborators from Gallaudet University Regional Center at Northern Essex Community College, the College of the Holy Cross, and the Learning Center for Deaf Children. Participating informal science education institutions are represented by the EcoTarium, Davis' Farmland, and the Stone Zoo. These partnerships provide the necessary expertise and support for the proposed project to have significant impact on advancing STEM learning in informal settings for children with hearing disabilities through the use of assistive learning technologies.","Classroom students need to engage with innovative technologies (IT) in ways that better match computer literacy skills and applications in today?s workplace. The NSF-funded ITEST teacher professional development projects address this need by helping teachers effectively integrate real-world IT-based investigations into K-12 curriculum. This ITEST Study will examine the ways that ITEST teacher education projects lead to changes in classroom practice by using two teacher-role models to examine technology-based professional development and related changes in teaching practices: Teacher as Pedagogical Expert (teachers using existing technology-based curriculum with or without adaptations) and Teacher as Curriculum Developer (teachers creating new curriculum). The study will explore these two models within the context of IT teaching and learning. Specifically, we want to understand what kinds of professional development activities promote and/or influence changes in teaching practices and the integration of innovative technologies in the classroom. We will address the following research questions: 1) What are the characteristics of the two teacher-role models (curriculum developer or pedagogical expert) in teacher professional development projects that immerse participants in professional IT experiences? and 2) Does IT classroom implementation differ for teachers who have and have not completed an IT-immersion professional development experience  and does the difference (if any) vary by model?The research design includes a review of current and past ITEST professional development activities (surveys/interviews with project leaders and project artifacts), a broad survey of teacher participants from ITEST teacher education projects, and an in-depth study of a subset of ITEST teacher participants and comparison teachers to trace classroom implementation over an academic year. This project is a collaboration between Education Development Center (EDC, Inc.), TERC and University of Maryland Center of Environmental Science, all of which have extensive experience with the NSF ITEST program.","This is a five-year project aimed at organizing a DRK-12 Resource Network to provide assistance for projects in areas such as research and development methods, implementation, and analysis procedures; synthesis of findings across the portfolio of projects; and national dissemination of the R&amp;D contributions of the DRK-12 program. To accomplish these goals, Education Development Center (EDC) will join efforts with Abt Associates Inc., and Policy Studies Associates to implement three major strands: (1) Technical Assistance, which consists of (a) a portfolio assessment to define it in terms of composition and major characteristics and identify project needs, (b) individual technical work services to project leadership, (c) focus groups, (d) thematic meetings, (e) Principal Investigators (PI) meetings, and (f) a web portal; (2) Portfolio Analysis, including (a) synthesis activities to capture a comprehensive view of the portfolio in order to understand the role that the program has played in advancing K-12 student and teacher learning, and (b) evaluative studies of selected projects describing specific contributions to the field; and (3) Dissemination, comprising (a) the development of a white paper to summarize research findings on dissemination and implementation of research in practice and policy settings and highlight examples from the portfolio, and (b) a series of dissemination-related workshops.","Computer Science (31)This collaborative project creates a multithreaded programming (MTP) course targeting general-purpose multi-core processors for the senior-level and graduate-level students in computer science and computer engineering.

The immediate goal of both the predecessor project and this project is to articulate explicit and new theory by which to leverage change in institutions of higher education such that they take up and use existing evidence-based knowledge and resources for STEM education.  A longer term goal is to translate new theory for leveraging change in higher education into strategies for action that will mobilize and coordinate the efforts of STEM researchers, educators, and organizations already seeking to improve quality and access in postsecondary STEM education; and also enable and sustain the collaborative contributions of this STEM education reform community.  An ancillary goal is to successfully encourage institutions of higher education and STEM departments to rebalance their values and reward systems to more readily recognize and enable teaching as a valued professional role for current and future STEM faculty, as a form of scholarship, and as a respected career path at the K-12 level for STEM undergraduates.  This project enlarges the group of critical advisors.  During its first year of work, the earlier project discovered through careful analysis of critical knowledge and skills that it needed to enlarge the planned size of this group by 25 percent.  The combined project is now known as the  Mobilizing STEM Education for a Sustainable Future  project.  The project focuses on postsecondary institutions, which are critical in developing these capacities because they educate natural and computer scientists, mathematicians, and engineers, and also K-12 teachers, policymakers, and workers in business and industry. After they are successfully recruited, the subsequent analyses, creative thinking, and recommendations of the critical advisors will be synthesized and distributed to the STEM higher education community. The scope of work entails: (1) participation in two workshops planned and executed by the National Research Council, described in a companion grant proposal; (2) preparation for and participation in two CA meetings as part of this project; (3) synthesis of ideas and recommendations offered at the two CA meetings; and (4) preparation, presentation, and distribution of a final National Endeavor Team report that integrates the synthesis of the CA meetings with the outcomes from the NRC workshops.","Computer Engineering (32)This collaborative project creates a multithreaded programming (MTP) course targeting general-purpose multi-core processors for the senior-level and graduate-level students in computer science and computer engineering.
